<h2>New multithreading scheme</h2>

<p>
After the old scheme to implement multithreading in
deal.II has proven to be too difficult, we
implemented something that is significantly more complex, but at the
same time significantly simpler to use. There is also a report on this
subject, explaining why's and how's, which can be accessed from the
<a href="../../documentation.html" target="body">documentation</a>
page.

/**
 * @page changes_between_2_0_and_3_0 Changes between Version 2.0 and 3.0

<p>
Version 3.0  of the deal.II object-oriented finite  element library is
available on the deal.II home-page at
</p>
<p align="center">
<a href="http://www.dealii.org" target="_top">

</a>
</p>

<p>
deal.II is a C++ program  library targeted at adaptive finite elements
and error estimation.  It uses state-of-the-art programming techniques
of the C++ programming language to offer you a modern interface to the
complex  data structures  and algorithms  required for  adaptivity and
enables you to use a variety of finite elements in one, two, and three
space dimensions, as well as support for time-dependent problems.
</p>

<p>
The library is written for research purposes and offers many features:
<ul>
<li><p> Support  for one, two, and  three space dimensions,  using a unified
  interface that enables writing programs almost dimension independent.</p>

<li><p> Handling of locally  refined  grids,  including  different  adaptive
  refinement strategies based  on  local error  indicators  and  error
  estimators.</p>

<li><p> Support  for  a  variety  of  finite  elements,  including  Lagrange 
  elements of order one through four, and discontinuous elements.</p>

<li><p> Extensive documentation: all documentation is available online in  a
  logical tree structure to allow fast access to the  information  you 
  need. If printed it comprises about 200 pages of tutorials,  several
  reports, and far more than  1,000  pages  of  programming  interface
  documentation with  explanations  of  all  classes,  functions,  and 
  variables.</p>

<li><p> Modern software techniques that make  access  to  the  complex  data
  structures and algorithms as transparent as  possible.  The  use  of 
  object oriented programming allows for program structures similar to
  the structures in mathematical analysis.</p>

<li><p> Fast algorithms that enable you to solve problems with up to several
  millions of degrees of freedom quickly. As  opposed  to  programming 
  symbolic algebra packages the penalty for readability is low.</p>

<li><p> Support for several output formats, including  some  common  formats 
  for visualization of scientific data.</p>

<li><p> Support for  a  variety  of  computer  platforms,  including  multi-
  processor machines.</p>

<li><p> Free source code under an Open Source license, and the invitation to
  contribute to further development of the library.</p>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.

</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fix: in three space dimensions, the triangulation class
       over-estimated the necessary amount of memory needed upon
       refinement and allocated too much.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: getting the support points from system finite elements
       (class <code>FESystem</code>) resulted in an
       exception. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code>FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> and
       <code>FullMatrix::Tvmult</code> were broken.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08 and 2000/05/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: slight bug in 
       <code>DataOut::build_patches</code>
       in multithreaded mode fixed.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann, 2000/05/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: 
       <code>SparsityPattern::print_gnuplot</code>
       wrote rows and columns exchanged. Since most matrices have
       symmetric sparsity patterns, this has gone unnoticed by now.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the 
       <code class="program">common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl</code> 
       script that sets up the dependencies for the make files had a
       problem when the path to the library included special characters
       such as `+'. This is now fixed.

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: All identifiers that the C++ standard (see
       <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/wp/dec96pub/"
       target="_top"> this page</a> for the public draft -- the
       standard itself is not available online for copyright reasons)
       mandates to be in namespace <code>std::</code> are correctly
       prefixed by the namespace name. While previous gcc compilers
       accepted these names also without the prefix, gcc 3.0 will
       require them, as do some commercial compilers.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In multithreading mode, the compile flags now also have 
       <code class="program">_REENTRANT</code> defined. If this flag
       is defined, then the standard Unix headers also declare
       reentrant versions (with suffix <code class="program">_r</code>)
       of many functions.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Major and minor version numbers of the
       deal.II library are now passed to the
       compiler as preprocessor variables
       <code class="program">DEAL_2_MAJOR</code> and
       <code class="program">DEAL_2_MINOR</code>. Their present values
       are 3 and 1, respectively. Variables of the same name are also
       available in Makefiles.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">step-9</code> example program is
       now ready, showing several advanced programming techniques in
       deal.II. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: deal.II now uses the 
       <code class="program">kdoc2</code> program to generate the API
       documentation. This makes up for much nices documentation and
       also works better than the previous <code class="program">kdoc1</code>.
       A copy of <code class="program">kdoc2</code> is provided within
       the deal.II source tree.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: when compiling files, the output generated by the
       <code class="program">make</code> program now indicates also
       whether we are compiling for multithread mode, besides the
       information whether the file is compiled for debug or optimized
       mode.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/06/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the 
       <code class="program">common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl</code> 
       script that sets up the dependencies for the make files had a
       problem when the path to the library included special characters
       such as `+'. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">configure</code> script now
       checks whether the <code>getrusage</code> function is properly
       declared (this function is used in the timer class). The
       problem is that on SunOS 4.x, this function exists, but is not
       declared in the right file (although it is listed in the man
       pages). We then have to declare it ourselves.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code class="program">configure</code> script now
       enforces the compiler flags <code>-ansi -pedantic</code> when
       compiling in debug mode. This should force us to write more
       standard compliant code. (Since the ACE library is not
       standards conforming, the <code>-ansi</code> flag is not used
       when multithreading is requested.)
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: the <code class="program">configure</code> script is
       now used to select the compiler options. Previously, selection
       of compiler options was done both in 
       <code class="program">configure</code> as well as in the global
       options Makefile 
       <code class="program">common/Make.global_options</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Dependence on the files 
       <code class="file">forward_declarations.h</code> has been widely
       removed to improve compilation time
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/24)
       </p>


  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code class="program">configure</code> now uses 
       <code class="program">config.guess</code> to determine the
       operating system and hardware platform.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: License is now deal.II Public
       License, restricting commercial use more explicitely.
       <br>
       (WB/RH/GK)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: exceptions <code>ExcIO</code> and <code
       class="class">ExcOutOfMemory</code> are defined globally now.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>ParameterHandler</code> now has a
       function <code>log_parameters</code> which
       allows output of all parameters to a log file.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: almost all classes that store data now have a function
       <code>memory_consumption</code> that returns an
       estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
       class. Supporting functions to compute the size of STL vectors
       and other objects can be found the 
       <code>MemoryConsumption</code> namespace.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/11/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>FunctionDerivative</code>
       computes finite difference approximations of a directional
       derivative of a <code>Function</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/11/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOutBase</code> and
       <code>DataOutBase::Patch</code> classes have been
       changed so as to allow output of objects that have an other
       dimension than the surrounding space, for example writing faces
       instead of cells (this might be useful to write only external
       faces in 3d computations).
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/07)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new <code>distance</code> function
       in the <code>Point</code> class that calculates the
       distance between two points.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/09/06)
       </p>   

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>Timer</code> now uses the system
       function <code>getrusage (RUSAGE_CHILDREN,
       .)</code> that is need in multithreading. But still the <code
       class="class">Timer</code> class does not yet work in
       multithreading, as getrusage with flag RUSAGE_CHILDREN gives always
       0 (at least on Solaris7).
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/08/25)
       </p>   

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now a set of functions
       <code>outer_product</code> that for the outer
       product of tensors.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/23)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: The classes 
       <code>Patterns::Integer</code>
       and <code>Patterns::Double</code> now allow that
       a range may be specified in which the parameter shall
       be. Furthermore, instead of a class,
       <code>Patterns</code> is now a namespace, so it
       can be reopened in case you want to write another pattern class
       and want to put it into the same namespace.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: classes <code>QMilne</code> and <code
       class="class">QWeddle</code> for closed Newton-Cotes-formul&aelig; of
       orders 7 and 9, respectively.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function <code>invert
       (Tensor<2,dim>)</code> that returns the inverse of a tensor of
       rank 2.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New multithreading scheme is implemented.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>Subscriptor</code> prints the
       real class name if a subscribed object is deleted.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/12)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>SparseILU</code> had two bugs which
       are now fixed.
       <br>
       (<a href="mailto:or@winfos.com">Oliver Rheinbach</a>, 2001/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: block classes have a variable number of blocks now,
       not a template parameter.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>BlockDiagonalMatrix</code> is a
       template that generates a matrix with multiple copies of the
       same block on the diagonal.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>

       Improved: Krylov-space solvers do not use the function residual
       anymore. This allows easier implementation of new matrix
       classes. <code>SolverGMRES</code> now also counts
       the first iteration step. Finally, all solvers inherit a <code
       class="class">Subscriptor</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions 
       <code>SparsityPattern::symmetrize</code> and
       <code>SparseMatrix::symmetrize</code> that
       generate a symmetric matrix from a non-symmetric one.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/12/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: almost all classes that store data now have a function
       <code>memory_consumption</code> that returns an
       estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
       class.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/11/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>
       SparseMatrix<number>::n_actually_nonzero_elements</code>
       returns the number of entries that are actually nonzero.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/11/22)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: unlike announced in the docs, the
       <code>FullMatrix::norm2</code> function did not
       return the Frobenius norm of a matrix, but its square. This is
       fixed now.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/08/28)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>PreconditionBlockSOR</code><code
       class="member">::Tvmult(...)</code> is implemented.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The breakdown criterion of <code
       class="class">SolverBicgstab</code> can be changed by the use
       of <code>SolverBicgstab::AdditionalData</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>SolverRichardson</code> has a
       transposed solver <code>Tsolve(...)</code>. It
       uses the functions <code>Tvmult(...)</code> of
       the provided matrix and preconditioner.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>FullMatrix</code><code
       class="member">::invert(...)</code> now inverts matrices of all
       sizes. If there is no hardcoded inversion, <code
       class="member">gauss_jordan()</code> is used implicitly.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: For recognizing a diverging solver before the maximum
       number of steps is reached, 
       <code>SolverControl</code> returns 
       <code>failure</code> also if the residual
       increases over the start residual by a specific factor. This
       factor is given to the <code>SolverControl</code> 
       object by the <code>set_failure_criterion</code>
       function. After calling the latter function, checking of this
       additional failure criterion may again be disabled by calling
       <code>clear_failure_criterion</code>.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/06/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The interface of preconditioner classes has changed.
       Preconditioners are now considered linear operators like
       matrices: they have members <code>vmult</code>
       and <code>Tvmult</code> instead of the old <code
       class="member">operator()</code>. This will allow the
       implementation of further non-symmetric solvers.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/06/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: there is now a function
       <code>SparseMatrix::el</code> that does mostly
       the same as <code>SparseMatrix::operator()</code>,
       but returns a zero if elements of the matrix are accessed that
       are not in the sparsity pattern. Thus, the new function allows
       to actually traverse rows or columns of the matrix without
       taking care of the sparsity pattern, while
       <code>SparseMatrix::operator()</code> should be
       used to write algorithms more efficiently.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: 
       <code>SparsityPattern::print_gnuplot</code>
       wrote rows and columns exchanged. Since most matrices have
       symmetric sparsity patterns, this has gone unnoticed by now.
       <br>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the 
       <code>FullMatrix::Tvmult</code> function
       suffered from the same problems as the
       <code>FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> function. This
       is now fixed as well.

       New: Class <code>PreconditionBlockJacobi</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>SolverControl</code> has an interface
       to <code>ParameterHandler</code>, defining and
       reading parameters from a file automatically.

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>BlockIndices</code>: Class that
       manages the conversion of global indices into a block
       vector/matrix/... to the indices local to each of the blocks. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>BlockSparsityPattern</code> and
       <code>BlockSparseMatrix</code>: Classes that
       represent matrices that are composed of sparse matrices.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the 
       <code>FullMatrix::mmult</code> and
       <code>FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> code don't
       resize their output argument any more, as this is not common
       style in the library. Furthermore, 
       <code>FullMatrix::Tmmult</code> was utterly
       broken. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Change: the <code>matrix_norm</code> functions
       of sparse and full matrices are renamed to 
       <code>matrix_norm_square</code>, since they in
       fact return the square of the norm. This should avoid confusion
       in some cases.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the ``copy-like'' constructor of 
       <code>SparsityPattern</code> that copies another
       object and adds some off-diagonals had a bug that caused an
       exception in some cases. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>SwappableVector</code>: Class that
       allows to swap out the data of a vector to disk and reload it
       later on. It also has a function to preload the data before its
       use in a separate thread if the library is configured for
       multi-threading.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: there are now functions <code>Vector::swap</code> 
       and <code>BlockVector::swap</code>, as well as
       global functions <code>swap(u,v)</code> that
       exchange the data of two vectors without needing a temporary
       vector and without copying around data. Their run-time is
       therefore independent of the length of the vectors.

  <li> <p>
       Fix: <code>SolverCG</code> counts steps properly.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Change: the solver classes in LAC lost their first template
       argument. Their names are now 
       <code>SolverXX&lt;VECTOR&gt;</code>, where
       <code>XX</code> denotes the name of the solver
       (e.g. CG, GMRES, etc). Furthermore, the
       inheritance from <code>Solver</code> was made private
       to reflect the logical structure.

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>PreconditionBlockSOR::set_omega</code>
       allows to change the relaxation parameter.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>SolverXX</code>: There is a virtual function
       <code>print_vectors</code> called in every step. It is void in the
       solver itself but can be used to print intermediate iteration
       vectors.

  <li> <p>
       Extend: <code>DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs</code>
       now allows to also specify which boundary conditions shall be
       considered. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/12/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: some arguments of the functions 
       <code>DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs</code>,
       <code>DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs</code>,
       and
       <code>DoFTools::map_dof_to_boundary_indices</code> 
       are changed from <code>list</code> to
       <code>set</code>, since that resembles more
       closely the purpose of the parameter, and makes computations
       slightly faster.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/12/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: almost all classes that store data now have a function
       <code>memory_consumption</code> that returns an
       estimate of the amount of memory (in bytes) used up by this
       class.

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>FiniteElement</code> has got two
       new functions <code>transform_unit_to_real_cell
       </code> and <code>transform_real_to_unit_cell
       </code>. They allow to transform points from reference (unit)
       cell to real cell and visa versa. <code
       class="member">transform_real_to_unit_cell</code> involves a
       Newton iteration and works for all dimensions and all mappings
       used to transform from unit to real cell.

       Extended: The <code>Triangulation</code>
       class can handle boundary information in 3d as well
       (i.e. lines and quads in 3d with special material IDs).

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>GridIn</code>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_optimize</code>
       function implements an alternative way to flag cells for
       refinement and coarsening.

       (Thomas Richter 2000/10/10)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>GridIn::delete_unused_vertices</code>
       function now eliminates vertices from the input that are not
       referenced by any of the cells in the input file. This makes is
       simpler to delete some cells from the input file by hand,
       without the need to update the vertex lists, which can be
       tiring as several cells usually use each vertex. All functions
       in the <code>GridIn</code> reading grids in
       several input files call this function before passing the data
       to the triangulation object.

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code>
       class is now able to estimate errors for several solution
       vectors at the same time, provided they live on the same
       <code>DoFHandler</code> object.

       (WB 2000/09/11)
       </p>       

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOut_Faces</code> class allows to
       output faces instead of cells. This might be handy for 3d
       computations if one is only interested in surface plots, or
       cuts through the domain.

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The 
       <code>DataOut_Old</code> class has finally gone for
       good. It was already deprecated in version 3.0, and has been
       superceded for a long time by the framwork of classes around
       <code>DataOutBase</code> and
       <code>DataOut</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/09/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function
       <code>DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs</code>
       that takes the list of selected boundary indicators as a
       <code>list</code> of values, rather than the
       usual <code>map</code> of pairs of boundary
       indicators and function object pointers.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/08/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The 
       <code>map_dof_to_boundary_index</code>
       functions have been moved from the <code>DoFHandler</code>
       to the <code>DoFTools</code> class, in order to
       further remove code from the big classes which is necessarily
       needed there.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/08/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: there is now a class <code>DataOutRotation</code>
       that can be used to output data which has been computed
       exploiting rotational symmetry, on the original domain. Thus,
       the output is of one dimension higher than the computation was,
       where the computed solution is rotated around the axis of
       symmetry.

  <li> <p>
       New: class <code>HalfHyperShellBoundary</code>

       <code>Triangulation::coarsen</code>,
       <code
       class="member">Triangulation::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction</code>,
       and
       <code
       class="member">Triangulation::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number</code>
       have been moved from the triangulation class to a separate
       class <code>GridRefinement</code> as they are not
       intricately bound to the triangulation but rather form a
       distinct class of functions that flag cells for refinement or
       coarsening based on error indicators.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/07/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>DataOut::clear_input_data_references</code>
       clears all reference to input data vectors and to the <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code>. This function may be useful
       after the patches have been built, to release memory as early
       as possible, in this case before the output is actually written.

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>class DerivativeApproximation</code>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: Add a missing assertions in <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_function_*</code>. If an <code
       class="class">ExcAccessToUninitializedField</code> is now thrown
       then probably an <code>update_values</code> or
       <code>update_gradients</code> is missing in the
       <code>UpdateFlags</code> of a used <code
       class="class">FEValues</code>. Adding this assertion uncovered
       several other errors which are now also fixed; these errors
       were dormant, since the values of finite elements are always
       computed for the presently available Lagrange elements, but
       would have been activated once there are other classes of
       elements.

       New: Class <code>DoFRenumbering</code> now has
       functions for cell-wise downstream renumbering for
       discontinuous elements. The parameters of the function <code

       New: The new function <code>get_face</code>
       of <code>FEFaceValues</code> and <code
       class="class">FESubfaceValues</code> returns an iterator of the
       present face. This is the face, for that the <code

  <li> <p>
       New: classes <code>FEDG_Px</code> implement
       complete polynomial spaces of degree <em>x</em> on
       quadrilaterals. Since they have less degrees of freedom than
       <code>FEDG_Qx</code>, there is no continuous
       version for these elements. Implementation for P4 and 3D is

  <li> <p>
       New: class <code>FETools</code> performs
       interpolations and extrapolations of discrete functions from one
       <code>FiniteElement</code> to another <code
       class="class">FiniteElement</code>. It also provides the local
       interpolation matrices that interpolate on each
       cell. Furthermore it provides the interpolation difference
       matrix id-I<sub>h</sub> that is needed for evaluating
       (id-I<sub>h</sub>)z for e.g. the dual solution z.
       </p>

       <p>
       Removed: The obsolete

       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>VectorTools::integrate_difference</code>
       allows for vector-valued weight functions. L<sup>1</sup> and
       L<sup>infinity</sup> norms are calculated correctly.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/05/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code>FE_DGx::restriction</code> is
       not an interpolation any more but a local projection which is
       more reasonable for DG elements.

  <li> <p>
       Changed: enum 
       <code>MeshSmoothing</code> is moved into the

       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/05/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>Triangulation<dim>::patch_level_1</code>
       is a new mesh smoothing. A mesh of patch level 1 consists of
       patches, i.e. they consists of cells that are all refined at
       least once.
       </p>

       <p>
       Changed: As follows from the existence of this new smoothing,
       <code>maximum_smoothing</code> will include this
       smoothing.

       <p>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/05/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the 
       <code>MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       now uses a much faster algorithm when working on matrices with
       symmetric sparsity patterns. On the other hand, it does no more
       eliminate whole rows when a matrix has a non-symmetric sparsity
       pattern, or if the user (through a new flag) tells the function
       that this is not necessary, for example if the matrix itself is
       non-symmetric. 
       </p>

       <p>
       For symmetric sparsity patterns, the algorithm now eliminates
       each boundary value in O(m*log(m)) steps instead of
       O(N*log(m)), where N=number of rows of the matrix, and m=number
       of entries per row. Note that m is roughly constant,
       irrespective of N, so the old algorithm became slower with
       finer grids, while the new one is O(1) for each boundary degree
       of freedom.

  <li> <p>
       New: many functions are now templatized on the data type of the
       vector they take or return. They thus now support
       <code>Vector&lt;float&gt;</code>, but also
       <code>BlockVector&lt;...&gt;</code>. An
       incomplete and growing list of functions that were treated in
       this way is:

       Change: <code>DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints ()</code>
       does not use the user flags any more, and can thus run in
       parallel more than once. 
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Extended: <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern ()</code>
       now accepts a template parameter as sparsity pattern. This
       allows to use this function for the usual 
       <code>SparsityPattern</code>, or for 
       <code>BlockSparsityPattern</code> arguments.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>DoFTools::extract_hanging_node_dofs ()</code>
       identifies nodes that will be constrained by hanging node constraints.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>DoFRenumbering::sort_selected_dofs_back ()</code>
       sorts selected degrees of freedom to the end of the index
       range.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Change: the return value of
       <code>DoFHandler::max_couplings_between_dofs ()</code>
       is bounded by <code>DoFHandler::n_dofs()</code>.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/05/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>FEValuesBase::get_cell ()</code>
       returns present cell.
       <br>
       (Ralf Hartmann 2000/05/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fix: <code>FESystem::reinit()</code> generated
       an exception if <code>update_support_points</code> 
       was set.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>IntergridMap::get_{source,destination}_grid</code> 
       functions return the grids for which the map was created.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: in three space dimensions, the triangulation class
       over-estimated the necessary amount of memory needed upon
       refinement and allocated too much.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs</code> 
       finds all degrees of freedom which are at the boundary and belong to
       specified components.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>DoFTools::compute_intergrid_constraints</code> 
       allows to use different discretization grids for different
       variables.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/04/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>DataOut::clear_data_vectors</code>
       allows to re-use an object without deleting the <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code>. 
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>class DoFPrintSolverStep</code> prints
       intermediate vectors of a solver as finite element functions using
       <code>DataOut</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2000/04/05)

 * @page changes_between_3_1_0_and_3_1_1 Changes between Version 3.1.0 and 3.1.1

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.
All entries are signed with the names of the author.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Templatized classes which had a default template
       argument that contains colons (such as nested types) did
       not show up in the forward declaration files, and were also
       missing from the class index. This is fixed now.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The vertex numbers written by the <code
       class="class">GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">write_ucd_faces</code> function are now also
       1-based. This, to be consistent with the vertex numbers given
       by the <code>GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">write_ucd</code> function.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the <code
       class="member">DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee</code> function
       did not work correctly when giving the <code
       class="member">reversed_numbering</code> flag (off-by-one
       indexing). This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (<a href="mailto:or@winfos.com">Oliver Rheinbach</a> 2001/04/12)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: When using Neuman boundary functions in the 
       <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code> class, it was
       assumed that the function object had <code
       class="member">Function::vector_value</code> overloaded, even
       in the scalar case. We now use <code
       class="member">Function::value</code> instead.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/09)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       New/Fixed: Now there exists a new <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">ExcMultiplySetLineInfoOfLine</code> exception,
       that is thrown if the <code>SubCellData</code>
       that is given to <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">create_triangulation</code>, multiply includes
       the line info of a specific line. Before the fix the wrong
       <code>ExcInteriorLineCantBeBoundary</code>
       exception was thrown.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/03)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Missing <code>ucd</code> is now added to the list of
       supported output formats returned by <code
       class="class">GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">get_output_format_names</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the program that generated HTML files from CVS back logs
       was run unintentionally. It failed because the distribution
       does not have the necessary CVS files. The program is no more
       run now.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the program that generated HTML from the example
       programs was broken on some platforms for reasons beyond our
       knowledge. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Roger Young, WB 2001/03/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Removed: The explicite instantiations of <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix&lt;long double&gt;</code> are removed as a
       prerelease of gcc3.0 fails to compile it. Now the user of <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix&lt;long double&gt;</code> needs to include
       <code>lac/include/lac/sparse_matrix.templates.h</code> into his
       source file and to use a different compiler, e.g. gcc 2.95.2 or
       a future version of gcc3.0 (that will then hopefully be fixed).
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: We now unconditionally include
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.templates.h</code>
       (which contains some inline functions for triangulation
       accessor classes) into 
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.h</code> to work
       around a problem with gcc3.0 which does not place a copy of
       these functions into the library. Previously we only included
       the file in optimized mode.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code>GridReordering::Cell</code> has
       now a copy constructor to work around a bug in a gcc3.0
       snapshot.
       <br>
       (RH, WB 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: a missing <code>const</code> prevented the <code
       class="class">PreconditionSelector</code> class to be
       compiled.
       <br>
       (Roger Young, John Burnell 2001/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Updated: the scripts <code>config.sub</code> and
       <code>config.guess</code> were updated to their newest
       versions, since <code>./configure</code> did not run properly
       on all systems. They are needed to determine the host system
       type correctly.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: in the triangulation, the <code
       class="member">straight_boundary</code> variable, which is a
       reference, was assigned the address of a temporary object. It
       is unclear how this could have worked for three years, but it
       apparently did...
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the <code
       class="member">DoFTools::compute_intergrid_constraints</code>
       function took memory quadratic in the number of degrees of
       freedom. This is now reduced to linear behaviour, with a
       constant that depends on the number of levels by which the two
       grids differ.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: example program step-11.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: example program step-10.
       <br>
       (WB, RH 2001/09/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code>./configure</code> script now also recognizes
       Compaq's cxx compiler. The library now also compiles cleanly
       with this compiler.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/07/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The libraries are no more linked using the C++
       compilation flags, but rather using LDFLAGS. Some compilers
       object to compilation flags on the linker line.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: If in multithreaded mode, the ACE library is now
       automatically added to the <code>\$(LIBS)</code> Makefile
       variable. There is no need anymore for a special clause in your
       Makefile.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code>./configure</code> script now also recognizes
       the Intel ICC compiler that was released for Linux lately. The
       library now also compiles cleanly with this compiler.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the program that generated HTML from the example
       programs was broken on some platforms for reasons beyond our
       knowledge. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Roger Young, WB 2001/03/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: libraries are now all in a subdirectory lib in the
       deal.II home directory. It is now easy to
       make this directory a link to put the libraries on a faster
       disk.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <a name="new_fe_mapping_design"></a>
       <i> New Design of <code>FiniteElements</code>
       and <code>Mappings</code></i>
              
       <p>
       New: The finite element
       classes have been redesigned from scratch to allow also
       elements that depend on the actual cell shape, like
       Raviart-Thomas, BDM or edge elements. We have implemented
       continuous Lagrange elements up to degree four and discontinous
       Lagrange elements up to degree 10. They can be easily extended
       to higher degree.
       </p>

       <p> 
       Furthermore we have totally reimplemented the mapping
       between unit and real cell.  In future we won't be restricted
       to Q<sub>1</sub> mapping any more, but we will have
       Q<sub>p</sub> mappings of arbitrary degree p. Presently
       implemented are mappings up to degree 10 in 2d, and degree
       three in 3d. This allows to approximate curved boundaries not
       only by straight lines (linear approximation) but also by
       quadratic, cubic, etc approximation. The finite elements will
       be able to be combined with arbitrary mappings. So in future we
       can use subparametric, iso- as well as superparametric
       elements.
       </p>

       <p>
       The new implementation uses a totally new structure of
       communication between <code>FEValues</code>, the
       <code>FiniteElements</code> and the <code
       class="class">Mappings</code>. Despite of this, the new
       structure will almost not be 'visible' to the user of
       deal.II as we tried to retain the interface
       to the user (mainly that of <code
       class="class">FEValues</code>) as far as possible.
       </p>

       <p>
       Together with this new design comes a reduction of 25000(!)
       lines of deal.II code. This elimination
       mainly affected code that previously was machine generated
       (e.g. by maple). In view of almost unchanged execution times of
       applications, the faster compilation and additional
       functionality constitutes a significant improvement of
       deal.II. Results produced by the new code
       match those of the old design up to machine precision.
       <br>
       (RH & GK 2001/03/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now some support to include and use routines from the 
       <a href="http://www.cse.clrc.ac.uk/Activity/HSL" 
       target="_top">Harwell Subroutine Library</a>.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/01/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>./configure</code> script now checks for the
       existence of a Fortran 77 compiler, and sets its path, some
       compiler flags and the libraries to be linked in when mixing
       C++ and F77 in some variables in the file
       <code>common/Make.global_options</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2000/12/30)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: Color function <code
       class="member">DataOutBase::EpsFlags::reverse_grey_scale_color_function</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Function <code>QProjector::project_to_child</code>
       generates quadrature formulae which act on the area which a
       child would occupy.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The examples classes in the base directory are now
       moved into a namespace <code>Functions</code> of
       their own. This improves encapsulation, but also keeps the
       documentation of these functions together, as they were
       previously scrambled all over the screen in the documentation
       page of the base library.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/07/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: classes <code>FourierSineFunction</code>
       and <code>FourierCosineFunction</code>,
       resembling one mode of a Fourier decomposition. Classes <code
       class="class">FourierSineSum</code> and <code
       class="class">FourierCosineSum</code>, resembling sums of such
       modes of a Fourier decomposition.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/07/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: class <code>vector2d</code> was introduced
       in analogy to STL class <code>vector</code>. The
       bew class provides a two-dimensional array and replaces the use
       of <code>FullMatrix</code> in the base library.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/05/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>JobIdentifier</code>::<code
       class="member">operator()</code> includes host name if
       supported by the operating system
       <br>
       (GK 2001/05/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">AutoDerivativeFunction</code> class that
       automatically computes the gradient of a function by employing
       numerical difference quotients. This only, if the user function
       does not provide the gradient function himself. This class can
       replace the <code>Function</code> class as base
       class for user defined <code>Function</code>
       classes.
       <br>
       This new class can be used if the user only implements the
       <code>value</code> function but wants to call
       also the <code>gradient</code> functions.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/05/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Quadrature</code> class now has a
       constructor that only accepts quadrature points and sets the
       weights to invalid values.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>Logstream</code>::<code
       class="member">get_prefix</code> allows access to the prefix
       string used for log-files.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a global function <code
       class="function">trace</code> that computes the trace of a tensor
       of rank 2.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Threads</code> now has a barrier
       class in order to synchronise multiple threads. In
       multithreaded mode, this is an alias to the <code
       class="class">ACE_Barrier</code> class of the ACE library, if
       deal.II is not configured for multithreading, then the class is
       a dummy class that does nothing.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: We now support the output format of the <a
       href="http://www.kitware.com/vtk.html"
       target="_top">Visualization Toolkit (Vtk)</a> from the <code
       class="class">DataOutBase</code> class and all derived classes.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code
       class="class">TensorProductPolynomials&lt;dim&gt;</code>
       performs the tensor product of 1d polynomials, computes its
       values, its first and second derivatives. If <code>n</code>
       polynomials are given to the constructor of this class, it
       constructs <code>n<sup>dim</sup></code> tensor product
       polynomials.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>LagrangeEquidistant</code> is a new
       class derived from <code>Polynomial</code>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code>Polynomial</code> class can
       be used as base class for all 1d polynomials. It stores the
       coefficients of the polynomial and uses the Horner scheme to
       evaluate values and all derivates.

  <li> <p> New: <code>Logstream</code>::<code

       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: the stopping criterion of <code
       class="class">SolverBicgstab</code> without computing the exact
       residual is implemented
       <br>
       (GK 2001/09/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>FullMatrix</code> class now has a
       function <code>operator*=</code>, which simply
       scales the matrix.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/02)

       (WB 2001/08/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a class <code>MatrixOut</code>
       which can be used to convert a matrix into a graphical output,
       for example in order to see visually that a matrix is
       diagonally dominant or not.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Base class <code>Solver</code> and all
       <code>Preconditioner</code> classes are now
       derived from <code>Subscriptor</code>.
       Class <code>PreconditionLACSolver</code> now uses
       smartpointers to the given solver and preconditioner
       objects. You will, therefore, have to derive your own

       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Classes <code>Vector</code> and
       <code>BlockVector</code> now have member functions
       <code>operator*=</code> which scale the vectors
       by a constant factor. These functions are aliases for the 
       <code>scale</code> member functions except that
       they return a reference to themselves.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function 
       <code>FullMatrix::precondition_Jacobi</code>. The

       therefore now also applicable with the full matrix class.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Vector</code> and
       <code>BlockVector</code> classes can now be
       initialized using a new constructor that takes two iterators
       that denote a range of elements which are to be copied.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>SolverCG</code> class now
       saves the initial matrix vector product if the initial value of
       the solution is vector is zero, as it is common practice to use
       this is starting vector.
       <br>

       zero.
       <br>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>CompressedBlockSparsityPattern</code>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code>
       may be used as an intermediate form of the <code
       class="class">SparsityPattern</code> class if memory
       requirements are tight during construction of the sparsity
       pattern.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions 
       <code>SparsityPattern::copy_from</code> and
       <code>SparseMatrix::copy_from</code>
       that can be used to construct sparsity patterns and matrix at
       once, i.e. without setting up a sparsity pattern element by
       element, possibly after using a way too large value for the
       maximal row length, then calling 
       <code>SparsityPattern::compress</code> etc.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/07)

       returns the size of a specified block.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/07)

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a (private) function <code
       class="member">SparsityPattern::optimized_lower_bound</code>
       that is used as an optimized replacement for <code
       class="member">std::lower_bound</code> for searching in the
       column number arrays. It unrolls small loops and it also seems
       that the compiler is able to optimized it better due to
       eliminated template parameters, making it about twice as fast
       as the standard implementation. In effect, it also speeds up
       the SSOR preconditioner that spent about one third of its time
       in that function by approximately 15 per cent.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>FilteredMatrix</code> class is a
       replacement for the <code
       class="class">MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       function for cases where you would like to solve several times
       with the same matrix, either for different right hand sides, or
       for different boundary values.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function <code
       class="class">Vector</code>::<code
       class="member">scale(Vector)</code>
       that scales each element of the vector by the corresponding
       element of the argument.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: Solver functions <code>solve</code>
       return void now. If the solver has not converged within the
       maximum number of iterations or encounters a breakdown, it
       throws an exception of type <code
       class="class">SolverControl</code>::<code
       class="member">NoConvergence</code> instead of
       returning a special value.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The functions <code>FullMatrix</code>::<code
       class="member">mmult</code> and <code
       class="member">Tmmult</code> now have an additional
       <code>adding</code> argument. If this flag is
       <code>true</code>, the matrix-matrix product is added to the
       resulting matrix; if <code>false</code>, the resulting matrix
       is set to (overwritten by) the matrix-matrix product. The
       latter is the behaviour these functions had before. Hence the
       default value is set to be <code>false</code> to ensure
       backward compatibility.

  <li> <p>
       New: class <code>SchurMatrix</code> implements
       a Schur complement for block matrices. It provides matrix-vector
       multiplication suitable for iterative methods as well as pre- and
       post-processing of right hand side and slution, respectively.

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The explicite instantiations of <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix&lt;long double&gt;</code> are
       removed as a prerelease of gcc3.0 fails to compile it. A user
       of <code>SparseMatrix&lt;long double&gt;</code>
       needs now to include
       <code>lac/include/lac/sparse_matrix.templates.h</code> into his
       source file and to use an appropriate compiler, e.g. gcc2.95.2 or
       a future version of gcc3.0 (that will then hopefully be fixed).

       New: class <code
       class="class">BlockMatrixArray&lt;MATRIX&gt;</code> implements
       a block matrix based on an array of matrix pointers. Since this
       array may be incomplete, no direct access to entries is

       <br>
       (WB 2001/08/16)

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>MatrixCreator</code> and <code
       class="class">MatrixTools</code> class have lost their template
       arguments. Rather, the individual functions now are templated
       on their own, so the compiler can pick out the correct space

       (WB 2001/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the  <code>GeometryInfo</code> class
       has been reverted from a general template that calculates the
       values of its member variables by recursion/induction to a set
       of explicitely specialized classes. This seemed necessary since
       most compilers objected to the old implementation as the
       declaration of the values of the class required knowledge of
       the elements of the class with one lower dimension which was,
       however, only being declared at present except for 1d. Also,
       allocating space for variables was difficult as that would mean
       declaring specializations after their first use. The new (and
       very old) implementation is entirely compatible to the previous
       one.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the classes that denote flags to the <code

       from local classes to a namespace of their own, names
       <code>TimeStepBase_Tria_Flags</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: due to a bug in gcc, the compiler did not check that we
       did not use the set of given boundary indicators to the
       <code>DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs</code>
       function in 1d. That set was therefore ignored. This is now
       fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/05/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the flags which are given to the <code
       class="class">GridOut</code> class to modify the appearance of
       the output have been moved from local classes of the <code
       class="class">GridOut</code> class to a namespace names
       <code>GridOutFlags</code> and have lost the
       trailing <code>Flags</code> part in their name.
       This change was necessary as C++ does not allow explicit
       specialization of member classes; the previous use in the
       library was only accepted by GCC as an extension.

       assumed that the function object had <code
       class="class">Function</code>::<code
       class="member">vector_value</code> overloaded, even
       in the scalar case. We now use <code
       class="member">Function</code>::<code
       class="member">value</code> instead.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/09)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       New: The various <code
       class="class">MatrixCreator</code>::<code
       class="member">create_*_matrix</code> functions
       are now using multiple threads to do their work, if the library
       is configured to use multithreading.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/04/08)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       New: The following functions are extended to work
       on arbitrary mappings:
       <br>
       The static <code>create_mass_matrix</code>,
       <code>create_boundary_mass_matrix</code> and
       <code>create_laplace_matrix</code> member
       functions of the class <code>MatrixCreator</code>,
       <br>
       the static <code>project</code> and <code
       class="member">project_boundary_values</code> member functions
       of the class <code>VectorTools</code>,
       <br>
       the two versions of the static <code
       class="member">estimate</code> member functions of the class
       <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code>,
       <br>
       and the static <code>approximate_gradient</code>
       and <code>approximate_second_derivative</code>
       member functions of the class <code
       class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code>.
       </p>

       <p>
       All these functions now take a <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> object as additional argument.
       <br>      
       For backward compatibility there exist second versions of
       each of these functions that still don't have a <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> argument. These functions
       implicitely use a mapping of the class <code
       class="class">MappingQ1</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: Along with the redesign of the <code
       class="class">FiniteElement</code> and the <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> classes the <code
       class="class">FiniteElement</code>::<code
       class="member">get_local_mass_matrix</code> function is now
       removed. This was necessary as the local mass matrix depends not only on the
       considered <code>FiniteElement</code> but also on
       the mapping between the unit to the real cell. Hence this function
       cannot be a member function of a <code
       class="class">FiniteElement</code> any more.
       </p>

       <p>
       As a consequence also the <code
       class="class">MatrixCreator</code>::<code
       class="member">create_mass_matrix</code> function with two
       arguments is removed, as it relied on the <code
       class="member">get_local_mass_matrix</code> function. If in
       future the user wants to create a mass matrix he needs to use
       one of the remaining <code
       class="class">MatrixCreator</code>::<code
       class="member">create_mass_matrix</code> functions that require
       an appropriate <code>Quadrature</code> as
       argument.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/04)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       New/Fixed: Now there exists a new <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">ExcMultiplySetLineInfoOfLine</code> exception,
       that is thrown if the <code>SubCellData</code>
       that is given to <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">create_triangulation</code>, multiply includes
       the line info of a specific line. Before the fix the wrong
       <code>ExcInteriorLineCantBeBoundary</code>
       exception was thrown.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/03)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Missing <code>ucd</code> is now added to the list of
       supported output formats returned by <code
       class="class">GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">get_output_format_names</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/04/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New/fixed: In some obscure corner cases, the detection logic in <code
       class="member">DataOut_DoFData::add_data_vector</code> would
       not have been able to detect whether something is a DoF data
       vector or a vector of cell data, and in some equally rare cases
       this would also have made a difference. This is now fixed by
       adding another argument to the function telling it either to
       automatically detect the vector type (default) or to assume
       that it has a certain type (for these corner cases).
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: the <code>ProblemBase</code> class,
       which has been deprecated since before the release of 
       deal.II 3.0, has finally been removed. The
       same applies for the classes
       <code>Assembler</code>,
       <code>Equation</code>,
       <code>MassMatrix</code>, and
       <code>LaplaceMatrix</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a class <code>MappingC1</code>
       that implements a continuously differentiable C<sup>1</sup>
       mapping of the boundary by using a cubic mapping with
       continuous derivatives at cell boundaries. The class presently
       only implements something for 2d and 1d (where it does nothing).
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The static <code>interpolate</code>, <code
       class="member">create_right_hand_side</code>, <code
       class="member">interpolate_boundary_values</code>, <code
       class="member">integrate_difference</code> and <code
       class="member">compute_mean_value</code> member functions of
       the class <code>VectorTools</code> are extended
       to work on arbitrary mappings. All these functions now take a
       <code>Mapping</code> object as additional
       argument. 
       <br>
       For backward compatibility there exist second versions of
       each of these functions that still don't have a <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> argument. These functions
       implicitely use a mapping of the class <code
       class="class">MappingQ1</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>Boundary</code> and derived classes
       now have a function <code
       class="member">get_normals_at_vertices</code> that returns a
       multiple of the normal vector to the boundary at the
       vertices of a given face. This is used in the construction of
       C<sup>1</sup> mappings of the boundary.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new function <code
       class="class">PersistentTriangulation&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">restore(unsigned int)</code> allows to restore
       the triangulation step by step.
       <br>
       New: Now there exists a function <code
       class="class">PersistentTriangulation&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">clear_flags</code> to allow to re-<code
       class="member">read_flags</code> without the need of clearing
       the triangulation in advance.
       <br>
       New: The new function <code
       class="class">PersistentTriangulation&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">n_refinement_steps</code> returns the number of
       refinement steps stored in <code
       class="member">refine_flags</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>GridGenerator</code>::<code
       class="member">hyper_rectangle</code> creates
       coordinate-parallel rectangles in arbitrary dimension.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/03/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The syntax of the <code
       class="class">FiniteElement&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">get_unit_support_points</code> function is
       changed; it returns a reference to the vector of points in lieu
       of taking this vector as argument. The unit support points are
       now computed by the constructor of the <code
       class="class">FiniteElement</code> and not on each <code
       class="class">FiniteElement&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">get_unit_support_points</code> function call as
       before.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Removed: The function <code
       class="class">FiniteElement&lt;dim&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">get_support_points</code>
       is removed as the <code>FiniteElement</code>
       cannot know the position of the support points by itself. This is
       because the support points depend on the unit support points
       (known to the <code>FiniteElement</code> class)
       but they also depend on the mapping.

       In future the support points can be computed using a <code
       class="class">FEValues</code> object initialized with the <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> and a <code
       class="class">Quadrature</code> that uses the unit support
       points as quadrature points.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The class <code>Boundary</code> has two new
       functions <code
       class="member">get_intermediate_points_on_line</code> and <code
       class="member">get_intermediate_points_on_quad</code> that
       needs to be implemented in derived classes only if <code
       class="class">GridOut</code> is used with <code
       class="class">MappingQ</code> of degree <code>p>2</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>

       New: The functions <code
       class="member">GridOut::write_gnuplot</code> and <code
       class="member">GridOut::write_eps</code> now take a pointer to
       a <code>Mapping</code> object as additional
       argument. This allows to write grids in 2d whereby cells with a
       curved boundary are transformed by the given <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> class. The default mapping is
       <code>MappingQ1</code>. Note, that the grids do
       not show the `original' domain with boundaries described by the
       <code>Boundary</code> classes but the
       discretized domain whose boundary cells are transformed using the
       given mapping.
       </p>
       There are also a new <code
       class="member">GnuplotFlags::n_boundary_face_points</code> and
       <code>EpsFlags::n_boundary_face_points</code>
       variables to set the number of additional points written
       to represent the curved boundary faces.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The constructor of the <code>FEValues</code>
       and <code>FE(Sub)FaceValues</code> classes now
       take a reference of a <code>Mapping</code> object
       as additional argument. This is the new possibility to combine
       a <code>FiniteElement</code> with an arbitrary
       <code>Mapping</code>, see also <a
       href="#new_fe_mapping_design">New FE and Mapping Design</a>.
       </p>

       <p>
       For backward compatibility there still exists a constructor of
       <code>FEValues</code> without a <code
       class="class">Mapping</code> argument that uses a <code
       class="class">MappingQ1</code> by default.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>
       
  <li> <p>
       Changed: We now unconditionally include
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.templates.h</code>
       (which containts some inline functions for triangulation
       accessor classes) into 
       <code>deal.II/include/grid/tria_accessor.h</code> to work
       around a problem with gcc3.0 which does not place a copy of
       these functions into the library. Previously we only included
       the file in optimized mode.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code>GridReordering::Cell</code> has
       now a copy constructor to work around a bug in a gcc3.0
       snapshot.
       <br>
       (RH, WB 2001/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: when refining a hexahedron in 3d, the rules by which
       the new vertices at the centers of the faces and at the center
       of the cell are placed, are changed. They are changed in a way
       as to minimize the distortion of the resulting cells from the
       optimal shape and to make them look as much alike as possible
       to generate a smoother grid.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/03/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: the <code
       class="class">DoFTools</code>::<code
       class="member">compute_intergrid_constraints</code>
       function took memory quadratic in the number of degrees of
       freedom. This is now reduced to linear behaviour, with a
       constant that depends on the number of levels by which the two
       grids differ.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fix: in the triangulation, the <code
       class="member">straight_boundary</code> variable, which is a
       reference, was assigned the address of a temporary object. It
       is unclear how this could have worked for three years, but it
       apparently did...
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>DoFTools</code> class now has
       a function <code>count_dofs_per_component</code>
       that counts the number of degrees of freedom in each of the
       components of the finite element, i.e. how many degrees of
       freedom there are on the global mesh for each variable (field).
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>CellAccessor</code> class now has a function
       <code>has_boundary_lines</code> that mostly has
       the same semantics that <code>at_boundary</code>
       has, but also covers the case that a hexahedron in 3d may be at
       the boundary only by one line, rather than by a whole face. In
       that case, <code>at_boundary</code> reports
       false, while <code>has_boundary_lines</code>
       reports true.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function
       <code>ConstraintMatrix</code>::<code
       class="member">merge</code> that merges
       the constraints represented by two constraint matrices into one
       object.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/01/31)

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.

<h2>Changes between versions 3.2.0 and 3.2.1</h2>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: In the <code>ParameterHandler</code>
       class, we leaked 8 or 12 bytes of memory per declared
       parameter. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: he <code>DoFHandler</code> class had a
       memory leak. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">FilteredMatrix::allocate_tmp_vector</code>
       function had a bug with block vectors.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: example program step-12. Discontinuous Galerkin
       discretization.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code
       class="member">CellAccessor<dim>::neighbor_of_coarser_neighbor</code>
       function returns where to find the present cell from a coarser
       neighbor.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: when checking for convergence in linear solvers in
       <code>SolverControl::check</code>, we first
       checked whether the maximal iteration count was reached, and
       only then whether the target residual was achieved. In cases,
       where the target residual was only reached in the very last
       allowed iteration, this led to a failure notice of the linear
       solver, rather than to a success message. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: an error in the definition of the <code
       class="member">SolverMinRes::solve</code> function prevented
       its compilation under some circumstances.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: upon breakdown, the <code
       class="class">SolverBicgstab</code> forgot to increment the
       iteration counter for the breakdown cycle. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the <code
       class="member">DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern</code> was
       implemented in 1d, but not instantiated. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the <code
       class="member">GridGenerator::hyper_rectangle</code> function
       was broken in 3d.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: class <code>SparsityPattern</code> can
       handle rows of length zero now. For quadratic matrices, these
       rows are changed to length one, since a diagonal element must
       be stored.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DataOutBase::EpsFlags</code>
       class forgot to declare the reverse grey scale function as one
       possible input for the color function for the
       <code>ParameterHandler</code> class. This is now
       possible.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the iterator category template base class of grid
       iterators was incorrectly set.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/28)
       </p>
</ol>

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       New: Output for 
       <a href="http://www.amtec.org" target="_top">Tecplot</a> has
       been added. It can be used by choosing output format tecplot.
       <br>
       (<a href="mailto:benkirk@cfdlab.ae.utexas.edu">Benjamin Shelton Kirk</a> 2002/01/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: configuration detects whether the compiler has the
       include file <code>&lt;ostream&gt;</code>. Most files in the
       library then include this file over
       <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> to save compile time.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/01/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: All example and test programs as well as a number of
       large applications have been checked against the memory checker
       "purify". Only three memory leaks were found and fixed. We
       believe that no major leaks exist in the library any more.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Output for 
       <a href="http://www.opendx.org" target="_top">OpenDX</a> has
       been added. It can be used by choosing output format dx (not
       yet for grid output). The data format is very basic now, but it
       is planned to improve this to make use of the excellent
       capabilites of OpenDX.
       </p>
       <p>
       Additionally, a directory <tt>contrib/dx</tt> has been added,
       containing visual programs for OpenDX. Programs for the
       existing output of data as a single vector are found in the
       subdirectory <tt>single</tt>.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: Previously, the \$(INCLUDE) variable in Makefiles
       included the values of the \$INCLUDE environment variable. This
       is not desirable, since the compiler evaluates that variable
       anyway and the Makefile variable has <code>-I</code> prefixed
       to all paths while the environment variable has not.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Removed: the option to generate printable documentation was
       removed. Since this comprised approximately 2000 pages and
       since we believe that the online documentation is rather good,
       this is probably no big loss.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: example program step-12. Discontinuous Galerkin
       discretization.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: deal.II now uses a file
       <code>config.h</code> for most global preprocessor defines,
       instead of an overly long list of compiler flags given on the
       command line.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: If available, the library now uses the C++ standard
       classes <code>istringstream</code> and <code
       class="class">ostringstream</code> over the old classes
       <code>i/ostrstream</code>. The ./configure script
       finds out whether the new classes exist, or whether the
       backward compatibility classes are to be used.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the ./configure script now recognizes gcc3.1
       (i.e. presently prereleases of it) and sets compilation flags
       accordingly.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/25)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: For Mac OS X, the file <code>base/source/log.cc</code>
       needed to include <code>sys/time.h</code> in addition to
       <code>sys/resource.h</code>.
       <br>
       (Alexis Herault, WB 2002/01/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: Private definitions of the copy constructor and
       assignment operator of the <code
       class="class">ParameterHandler</code> class are now included in
       order to inhibit the (unintentional) use of default copy
       constructors.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/01/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The cut-off functions <code
       class="class">Functios::CutOffFunctionLinfty</code>, <code
       class="class">Functios::CutOffFunctionW1</code>, and <code
       class="class">Functios::CutOffFunctionCinfty</code> can be
       vector-valued now and optionally only a single componente can
       be selected.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/01/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code
       class="member">deal_II_exceptions::set_additional_assert_output</code>
       function allows to set additional output to be printed upon
       triggering an <code>Assert()</code> call. This
       is helpful for parallel applications where you only see the
       text of the message but do not know from which cluster node it
       stems.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/01/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: when an assertion fails in the <code
       class="member">Assert()</code> function, the program is usually
       aborted. Don't abort it any more if there is an active C++
       exception somewhere since we would lose its message if we
       aborted the program. In that case only report the error and
       write out an indication why we do not abort the program any
       more. On the other hand, also suppress output of further failed
       <code>Assert()</code> calls, since they often
       are follow-ups of the first one.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/01/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>ExcFileNotOpen</code> can be used
       after initializing an <code>fstream</code>
       object. This allows to avoid some cryptic <code
       class="class">ExcIO</code>s.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/12/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>OutputStyle</code> enum used
       to indicate the output format has been moved into the
       <code>ParameterHandler</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: In the <code>ParameterHandler</code>
       class, we leaked 8 or 12 bytes of memory per declared
       parameter. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>Functions::CutOffFunctionCinfty</code>,
       <code>Functions::CutOffFunctionW1</code>, and
       <code>Functions::CutOffFunctionLinfty</code>
       implement functions with support in an arbitrary ball and
       differentiability as indicated by their name
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DataOutBase::EpsFlags</code>
       class forgot to declare the reverse grey scale function as one
       possible input for the color function for the
       <code>ParameterHandler</code> class. This is now
       possible.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/10)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>

       Improved: all sparsity pattern classes have a function <code
       class="member">exists</code>, allowing you to check whether a
       certain index pair has been allocated in the pattern.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/02/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Allocation of temporary vectors in <code
       class="member">FilteredMatrix::allocate_tmp_vector</code>
       is now faster since it does no more copy the value of the
       template vector.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">FilteredMatrix::allocate_tmp_vector</code>
       function had a bug with block vectors.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: reinit function of <code>Vector</code>
       and <code>BlockVector</code> allows use of a
       vector with different number type.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/11/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: when checking for convergence in linear solvers in
       <code>SolverControl::check</code>, we first
       checked whether the maximal iteration count was reached, and
       only then whether the target residual was achieved. In cases,
       where the target residual was only reached in the very last
       allowed iteration, this led to a failure notice of the linear
       solver, rather than to a success message. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: the <code>SparseDirectMA27/47</code> classes
       now provide access to Mutex locks for external
       synchronisation. 
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: an error in the definition of the <code
       class="member">SolverMinRes::solve</code> function prevented
       its compilation under some circumstances.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: upon breakdown, the <code
       class="class">SolverBicgstab</code> forgot to increment the
       iteration counter for the breakdown cycle. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: class <code>SolverGMRES</code> accepts
       a parameter in <code>AdditionalData</code>,
       allowing for right preconditioning.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/11/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: class <code>SparsityPattern</code> can
       handle rows of length zero now. For quadratic matrices, these
       rows are changed to length one, since a diagonal element must
       be stored.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>BlockVector</code> now has a
       full-fledged random access iterator type, working in exactly
       the same way as the iterators of the C++ standard containers.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: <code>Vector</code>::<code
       class="member">operator *</code> is now templatized, allowing
       for scalar products of vectors with different underlying types.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/27)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: The classes <code>FEQ1</code>-<code
       class="class">FEQ4</code>, <code
       class="class">FEDG_Q1</code><code>FEDG_Q4</code>
       as well as the files with their definitions,
       <tt>fe/fe_lib.lagrange.h</tt> and <tt>fe/fe_lib.dg.h</tt>
       ceased to exist. They had been left in for backward
       compatibility in an earlier version, but their existence is
       more confusing than helpful. Please change your code to use the
       classes <code>FE_Q</code> and <code
       class="class">FE_DGQ</code>, respectively.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/02/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>FilteredIterator</code> class
       provides a view on ranges of iterators by iterating over only
       those objects that satisfy a certain predicate.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/01/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: It is now possible to read in unconnected domains
       through the <code>GridIn</code> class, since
       renumbering the cells now also works for these domains.
       <br>
       (<a href="mailto:ms@biomech.tu-graz.ac.at">Michael Stadler</a> 2001/12/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Both functions <code
       class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">compute_mean_value</code> take ingoing and
       outgoing vector types as template arguments. This allows
       applying them to <code>BlockVector</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>GridGenerator</code> has a function
       <code>cylinder</code> for cylinders in three
       space dimensions. Accoridngly, a class <code
       class="class">CylinderBoundary</code> has been created.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/12/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>FiniteElement</code>::<code
       class="member">has_support_on_face</code> allows to check
       whether a shape function has non-zero values on a certain face
       of a cell.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/12/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>IteratorState</code> enum used
       to indicate the state in which an iterator can be is now
       enclosed in a namespace of the same name, to take its members
       out of the global namespace. When using one of these members,
       you now have to prefix it by <code
       class="class">IteratorState::</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>NormType</code> enum used to
       indicate the norm the <code
       class="member">VectorTools::integrate_difference</code>
       function shall integrate is moved from the global namespace
       into the <code>VectorTools</code> class. You
       therefore have to prefix the members of this enum by the
       respective class name.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The functions <code
       class="member">Mapping::transform_unit_to_real_cell</code>
       leaked some memory. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH, WB 2001/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DoFHandler</code> class had a
       memory leak. This is now fixed. Likewise for the <code
       class="class">MGDoFHandler</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">GridRefinement::refine</code>
       function failed when the threshold was zero. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">MappingQ<dim>::transform_real_to_unit_cell</code>
       function failed on a very unusual cell. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code
       class="member">CellAccessor<dim>::neighbor_of_coarser_neighbor</code>
       function returns where to find the present cell from a coarser
       neighbor.
       <br>
       (RH 2001/11/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">GridRefinement::refine_fixed_fraction</code>
       function sometimes had problems when indicators vary over
       several orders of magnitude, due to roundoff. This is now
       fixed. 
       <br>
       (WB 2001/11/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code
       class="member">DoFTools::extract_subdomain_dofs</code> selects
       those degrees of freedom which are located on cells with a
       specified subdomain id.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Cells now have an additional property
       <em>subdomain_id</em> which can be used in parallel
       computations to identify which cells are handled on which
       processor. These flags are read and set using the functions
       <code>cell->subdomain_id()</code> and <code
       class="member">cell->set_subdomain_id(new_id)</code>. The
       subdomain ids are unsigned integers, so should be sufficiently
       large also for larger numbers of subdomains.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the <code
       class="member">GridGenerator::hyper_rectangle</code> function
       was broken in 3d.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/10/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Both functions <code
       class="class">DataOut_DoFData</code>::<code
       class="member">add_data_vector</code> accepts <code
       class="class">BlockVector</code> as argument.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Both functions <code
       class="class">VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">integrate_difference</code> take ingoing and
       outgoing vector types as template arguments. This allows
       applying them to <code>BlockVector</code> and of
       outputting a vector of doubles suitable for <code
       class="class">DataOut</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Functions creating sparsity patterns for DG elements in
       <code>DoFTools</code> get the pattern type as
       template argument, too..
       <br>
       (GK 2001/10/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: the iterator category template base class of grid
       iterators was incorrectly set.
       <br>
       (WB 2001/09/28)
       </p>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: In 3d, the function <code
       class="member">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</code> 
       contained an assertion that failed erroneously for finite
       elements that do not have degrees of freedom on vertices. This

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       <strong>
       Deprecated: The functions <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_values</code>, <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_grads</code>, and <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_2nd_derivatives</code> are
       now deprecated as they expose too much of the internal data
       structure of their class, and interfere with plans for the
       extension of this and related classes. The functions still
       exist in this release of the library, but will be removed in
       the next version. Use the <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::shape_value</code> and alike
       functions as a replacement.

       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Added: The <code>configure</code> script now recognizes Intel's ECC
       compiler when run on Itanium systems with this compiler present.
       The ECC compiler is similar to the ICC compiler but it acccepts some
       different options.
       <br>
       (BK 2002/05/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The step-14 example program demonstrates duality based
       error estimators and some more software design concepts.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/05/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: In all previous versions, deal.II used
       the <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html"
       target="_top">ACE (Adaptive Communications Environment)</a>
       library to support cross-platform threading
       facilities. While this is still supported, the default way
       is now to use the POSIX threading functions that are
       available on many systems. The relieves you from the need of
       installing a huge library of which the most part is not used
       anyway. However, if you use ACE for other reasons, then it is
       still supported. For installation instructions, see the 
       <a href="../../readme.html" target="body">ReadMe</a> file.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/04/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The Makefiles for the library are now truly
       parallel. To this end, the automatic generation of the files
       <tt>forward_declarations.h</tt> in the various directories had
       to be changed. They will now be generated automatically at the
       end of the targets <tt>all</tt>, <tt>debug</tt> and
       <tt>optimized</tt>. They will not be generated while building a
       single library. In this case, <tt>make forward</tt> can be used
       to build them manually.
       <br>
       I introduced separate targets for the generation of the
       optimized versions only.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/04/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The step-13 example program tells you something about
       software design things for finite element programs.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/04/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Due to problems with undeclared functions and general
       compatibility concerns, <code>-ansi</code> is now no more part
       of the compile flags for gcc.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/04/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: Explicit specializations of member templates are now
       conforming to the C++ standard. While most compilers accepted
       the previous form, Sun's Forte compiler wants a strictly
       conforming one.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: For gcc versions that used <code
       class="class">ostrstream</code> instead of <code
       class="class">ostringstream</code>, it was necessary to append
       a final <code>std::ends</code> when piping text
       into the string stream. This was not previously
       conditionalized, but done for old and new classes.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The configure machinery has been revamped
       significantly.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Added: The top-level Makefile now supports "optimized" as a
       target that builds only optimized versions of the <code>base</code>,
       <code>lac</code>, <code>1d</code>, <code>2d</code>, and <code>3d</code>
       libraries. 
       <br>
       (BK 2002/02/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The build system was entirely revised. Object
       files in debug mode now have the suffix <code>.g.o</code>
       instead of <code>.go</code>. All object files from the
       subdirectories are now placed into the <code>/lib</code>
       top-level directory, rather than in library directories in the
       individual subdirs.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/02/11)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>vector2d</code> row accessor
       classes now have member functions <code
       class="member">begin</code> and <code>end</code>
       which allow iterating over the elements of a row of such an
       object. 
       <br>
       (WB 2002/05/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>Legendre</code> and
       <code>LagrangeEquidistant</code> classes now have
       static member functions <code
       class="member">generate_complete_basis</code> which returns an
       array of polynomial objects spanning the complete space up to a
       specified order in 1d. This may be used to generate the
       respective polynomial spaces in higher space dimensions.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/05/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>Polynomial</code> and
       <code>LagrangeEquidistant</code> classes have lost
       their default constructor, as that did not make much sense
       anyway.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/05/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: When forward declaring the <code
       class="class">Tensor</code> class, we now also forward declare
       its partial specialization for a rank one tensor. Not doing so
       confused Sun's Forte compiler.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The class <code>TensorFunction</code>
       now uses local types <code>value_type</code> and
       <code>gradient_type</code> as return values of
       its member functions. This works around a bug in Sun's Forte
       C++ compilers.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Improved: The <code>AssertThrow</code> macro now
       uses <code>__builtin_expect</code> if the
       compiler supports this. This indicates to the compiler that we
       expect the condition to be true and that throwing an exception
       is a rare case. By this information, the compiler can help the
       branch prediction unit of modern processors to better predict
       which direction a branch will take.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>vector2d</code> class now not only
       allows access to elements through the <code
       class="member">operator()(unsingned int,unsigned int)</code>
       (i.e. matrix or Fortran style access), but also through nested
       brackets via an <code>operator[]</code>
       (i.e. like to a two-dimensional C-style array).
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/08)
       </p> 

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The function <code>MultithreadInfo</code>::
       <code>get_n_cpus</code> now reports the proper number
       of CPUs when running on Silicon Graphics.
       <br>
       (BK 2002/02/19)
       </p> 

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The quite logorrhoeic function name <code
       class="class">TensorProductPolynomials</code>::<code
       class="member">n_tensor_product_polynomials</code> was changed to
       <code>n</code> to be compliant wth the new class <code
       class="class">PolynomialSpace</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/02/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The class <code>PolynomialSpace</code>
       implements the space of polynomials at most a certain degree in
       arbitrary space dimensions.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/02/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The function <code>DataOutBase</code>::
       <code>write_tecplot_binary</code> has been
       added.  This function will write Tecplot binary files if the
       Tecplot API is detected by ./configure.  To use this feature be
       sure that the environment variable TECHOME points to a valid
       Tecplot installation and that the files
       $TECHOME/include/TECIO.h and $TECHOME/lib/tecio.a exist.  The
       name of the file to be written is specified through the <code
       class="class">DataOutBase</code> ::<code
       class="member">TecplotFlags</code>.  <code
       class="member">tecplot_binary_file_name</code> variable. If the
       API is not available this code simply calls the existing ASCII
       output function.
       <br>
       (BK 2002/02/11)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Improved: <code>SolverGMRES</code> allocates
       basis vectors only, when they are needed. Therefore, it is safe
       now to ask for a basis larger than the expected number of
       iteration steps. On the other hand, memory allocation failures
       may occur during the iteration now.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Function <code
       class="member">SparsityPattern::matrix_position</code> is the
       inverse function for <code
       class="member">SparsityPattern::operator()</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/02/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Functions <code
       class="member">SparsityPattern::copy_from</code> and <code
       class="member">SparseMatrix::copy_from</code> allow to copy a full
       matrix into a sparse matrix.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/02/06)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>GeometryInfo</code> class now
       provides two methods,
       <code>unit_cell_vertex</code> and <code
       class="member">vertices_adjacent_to_line</code>, that reveal
       something about the placement and numbering of vertices on the
       uni cell.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/05/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>GridOut::</code>
       <code>write_dx</code> function is now implemented.
       It allows to write the mesh (cells and faces) with some additional
       information that may be useful once in a while.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/05/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>IteratorState::IteratorState</code>
       enum is now called <code
       class="class">IteratorState::IteratorStates</code>. This works
       around a bug in Sun's Forte C++ compilers which can't handle
       members of namespaces with the same name as the enclosing
       namespace.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/03/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: In 3d, the function <code
       class="member">DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints</code> 
       contained an assertion that failed erroneously for finite
       elements that do not have degrees of freedom on vertices. This
       is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2002/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: <code>TriaAccessor<3,3>::measure</code>
       sometimes computed a negative value. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2002/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite element family with complete polynomial spaces
       for discontinuous Galerkin: <code>FE_DGP</code>
       <br> 
       (GK 2002/02/11)
       </p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: deal.II now uses a new threading
       scheme. The new scheme is simpler to use, and in particular
       more flexible in some cases where only one thread is started,
       or where a thread is completely detached, since we got rid of
       the <code>ThreadManager</code> class and now only store handles
       to individual threads (which can be discarded, or added to a
       <code>ThreadGroup</code> variable that is able to wait for a
       whole set of threads at once.
       <br>
       The new scheme also implements a much needed feature: calling
       functions on a new thread that return values. Previously, such
       functions needed to be written in a way that they return their
       return value through an additional reference parameter. This
       was inflexible if one wanted to call functions that already
       exist. This restriction is now lifted: such functions can be
       called, and the return value can be accessed once the thread
       has finished.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: deal.II now makes use of some parts of
       the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a> library, which is
       supposed to be a testground for the next generation C++ standard
       library. The parts which we use are now in
       <code>contrib/boost/include/boost_local/</code> and can be
       referenced from within your programs. The directory contains
       the string <code>_local</code> since you may still want to use
       another version or installation of boost in your own programs.
       </p>
       
       <p>
       Also note that boost is large -- much larger than the subset we
       have imported --, so we only took what we needed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: A longstanding bug in the documentation system has been fixed: if
       a namespace was ended with <code>}</code> instead of <code>};</code>
       (note the semicolon), then the documentation tool assumed that the
       following entities were still part of the namespace just left. This was
       since the closing brace alone was not accepted as ending a namespace
       (after all, structures, classes, and enums -- the other entities that
       can enclose other declarations -- need the semicolon). This led to some
       classes not showing up in the class index of the sublibraries. This is
       now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Classes and structures that are declared inside namespaces named
       <code>internal</code> are now no longer shown in the class
       index view of the documentation of each of the sublibraries. Since they
       are supposed to be used internally only, this is no drawback for the
       general public. However, they are documented as members of these
       namespaces.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: Some of the formulas in the step-14 tutorial were obviously 
       scrambled a little. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Roy Stogner, WB 2003/01/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The main Makefile has been changed to sequentialize building 
       the base, lac, and deal.II sublibraries. We changed this, since on some
       systems (notably AIX), the latter libraries need to be linked against
       the former ones, when creating shared libraries.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Changes have been made to support compiling and using 
       deal.II on AIX 5 systems.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Removed: Thread support now relies solely on the use of POSIX
       functions. The use of the
       <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/ACE.html" target="_top">ACE
       (Adaptive Communications Environment)</a> library for this is now no
       longer supported. However, application programs can of course still use
       ACE, but they will need to generate paths to this library in their
       makefiles themselves.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Some changes have been made to support Mac OS X 10.2. Shared
       libraries are not supported on this architecture, but everything else
       should work.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/12/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: deal.II can be compiled with version 7.0 of
       Intel's icc compiler, which was recently released. Since this compiler
       finally supports the very restrictive flags <code>-Xc -ansi</code> that
       check for close conformance with the C++ standard, we use them (previous
       versions of icc would crash when these two flags are given). This
       requires that we distinguish between these compiler versions, and the
       corresponding Makefile variable <code>GXX-VERSION</code> now no longer
       holds the non-versioned string <code>intel_icc</code> when icc is
       detected, but rather either <code>intel_icc5</code>,
       <code>intel_icc6</code>, or <code>intel_icc7</code>, depending on what
       version of the compiler was detected.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/12/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Previously, we just set the preprocessor variable
       <code>DEAL_II_USE_MT</code>, when <code>--with-multithreading</code> was
       given as argument to <code>./configure</code>. Tests in the code
       therefore looked like <code>#ifdef DEAL_II_USE_MT</code>. This has been
       changed so that the variable is always defined, but its value is now
       equal to <code>1</code> 
       when multithreading was requested, and zero otherwise. The reason for
       this is that you can now write <code>if (DEAL_II_USE_MT && ...)</code>
       conditions, and need not interleave if-else clauses from regular code
       and the preprocessor, if conditions involve both the state of this
       preprocessor variable and the run-time state of your program. However,
       this change requires that all appearances of <code>#ifdef
       DEAL_II_USE_MT</code> be changed to <code>#if DEAL_II_USE_MT ==
       1</code>, since the variable is now defined unconditionally.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/11/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Object files are now named according to the local defaults
       on the system we are running on. On Unix systems, this is
       usually a <code>.o</code> suffix, while on Windows it is
       <code>.obj</code>. Likewise for executables, which have no
       suffix on Unix, but <code>.exe</code> on Windows.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/11/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: deal.II can now also be compiled with Red Hat's
       version of the gcc compiler, gcc 2.96. However, some problems remain;
       for more information.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: On CygWin, one header files has a <code>#define quad
       quad_t</code>. This is annoying, since we have local variables and
       member functions with the name <code>quad</code>, and in fact it breaks
       compilation on those versions of CygWin that has this. Fortunately, the
       define is only active if a preprocessor variable
       <code>_POSIX_SOURCE</code> is not set. Thus, we now check for the define
       when configuring the library, and if necessary set the preprocessor
       variable. However, while this allows to compile the library on these
       systems, it may otherwise affect your code, if you use functions or
       other features of the system that are not available when the flag is
       set.

  <li> <p> 
       New: Since <code>math.h</code> only defines the values of PI or E (as
       <code>M_PI</code> and <code>M_E</code>) when certain defines are set (on
       Linux, these are <code>__USE_BSD</code> or <code>__USE_XOPEN</code>),
       portable programs usually defined these constants themselves. In
       deal.II, this happened at 6 different places. To
       avoid this in the future, <code>base/config.h</code> now exports a
       namespace <code>deal_II_numbers</code> that defines these two, and a
       number of other numerical constants.

  <li> <p> 
       New: <code>base/config.h</code> now exports the

       <code>DEAL_II_PATH</code> preprocessor variable.

  <li> <p> 
       Removed: The forward declarations files have gone. We have never
       propagated their use in the example programs, but these files have been
       there in the base, lac, and grid include directories, and forward
       declared all classes that were present in the respective parts of the
       library. This, the idea was, enables you to use just this include file
       in your own header files, rather than including the full declarations of
       these classes. However, maintaining these forward declaration files has
       been a constant thorn in our side, be it that the timing of their
       generation was difficult when using parallel builds, or that they were
       difficult to generate at first. The latter is now the reason for their
       abolition: we had a script for their generation, but it did not take
       into account namespaces, so we got clashes when we found that we had
       used the same class name in two different namespaces, since the script
       put the forward declaration incorrectly into the global namespace where
       they conflicted. Since we do not plan to extend the script by a
       parser that can properly handle opening and closing braces of
       namespaces, we simply drop these files.
       <br>
       What you should do if you have used these forward declaration files: you
       have two possibilities - either include the respective header file in
       which the class is fully declared, or write the forward declaration into
       your headers yourself.

  <li> <p> 
       New: There is now
       a new report
       on assembling matrices available from the 
       <a href="../documentation.html" target="body">documentation
       page</a>. The main focus is assembling of matrices for
       vector-valued problems, where shape functions are
       vector-valued, and may have only one or more non-zero vector
       components. 
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The functions <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_values</code>, <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_grads</code>, and <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::get_shape_2nd_derivatives</code> are
       now removed as they expose too much of the internal data
       structure of their class, and interfere with plans for the
       extension of this and related classes. These functions, which
       had been deprecated in the previous version, are thus not
       part of the release after version 3.4 any more. Use the <code
       class="member">FEValuesBase::shape_value</code> and alike
       functions as a replacement.

  <li> <p> 
       New: deal.II now also supports vector-valued
       finite elements with shape functions for which more than just
       one vector component is non-zero. Such elements are, for
       example, the Nedelec and Raviart-Thomas families. Previously,
       vector-valued elements were only supported insofar as they
       could be composed of scalar ones; in that case, each
       (vector-valued) shape function had only one non-zero vector
       component.

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>Polynomials::Legendre</code>

       it had just crept in.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/05/12)

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a class <code

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>Table</code> accessor classes
       have been moved to a namespace <code
       class="class">internal</code>. Since these classes are not (or should
       not be) used directly in applications, this should not change
       compatibility. However, they will now no longer show up in the class
       overview of the documentation, which they were cluttering up.

       (WB 2003/02/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>Function</code> class now has an assignment
       operator. This way, you can put function objects into
       containers. However, the assignment operator makes sure that only
       objects can be assigned that have the same number of vector components.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>ThreadMutex</code> classes now have a
       member class <code>ScopedLock</code> that implements the
       scoped thread-safe locking pattern of Doug Schmidt. It is also used in
       various places of the code now.

       (WB 2003/01/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>PosixThreadManager</code> called
       its <code>wait</code> function in the
       destructor. If this had been called before already, then the
       same threads would have been waited for twice, which invokes
       undefined behavior. This is fixed by making sure that <code
       class="member">wait</code> removes the id's of the threads it
       has already waited for, and so calling it more than once will
       not wait for threads which have already been waited for.
       <br>
       (Michael Anderson, WB 2003/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>Subscriptor</code> uses a counter to
       count how many <code>SmartPointer</code> objects subscribe
       to the pointed-to object. This counter needs to be a volatile variable
       in multithreaded mode, to avoid false compiler optimizations based on
       the assumption that the variable cannot change between two subsequent
       reads.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: In multithreaded mode, when a new thread is started, the
       arguments to the function being called need to be copied from the stack
       of the starting thread to that of the new thread. In order to
       synchronise this, mutexes were used that were acquired from one thread
       and released from another thread. On Linux this does not lead to
       problems, but POSIX functions do not guarantee that this actually works,
       and it also leads to problems when running programs under valgrind. This
       is now fixed with the help of condition variables.

       (Michael Anderson, WB 2003/01/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: There are now classes <code>ThreadCondition</code>
       that implement thread condition variable operations through POSIX

       mode).
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Newer versions of gcc have a very nice feature: you can set
       a verbose terminate handler, that not only aborts a program
       when an exception is thrown and not caught somewhere, but
       before aborting it prints that an exception has been thrown,
       and possibly what the std::exception::what() function has to
       say. Since many people run into the trap of not having a
       catch clause in main(), they wonder where that abort may be
       coming from. The terminate handler then at least says what is
       missing in their program.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/12/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: There is now a <code>Patterns::List</code> pattern
       that matches a list of elements each of which has to satisfy a pattern
       that was given to the constructor.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/11/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: In POSIX mode, when the <code
       class="member">ThreadManager</code> class created a new thread through
       <code>pthread_create</code>, it only checked for the
       error code and aborted if it was non-zero. Now, it checks whether the
       error code is <code>EAGAIN</code> and simply retries the
       call if this is the case. This may, in rare cases, lead to a deadlock or
       an infinite loop, but will usually just wait until the respective
       resources for thread creation are available from the operating system
       and will then succeed.

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>write_text</code> and <code
       class="member">write_tex</code> functions of the <code
       class="class">TableHandler</code> class now check whether their
       <code>ofstream</code> arguments are in a proper state before
       using them for output.

  <li> <p> 
       New: Added Hierarchical Polynomial (similar to Legendre class). Will
       eventually be used in a hierarchical FiniteElement class similar to
       FE_Q class. Included in Polynomials namespace.
       <br>
       (Brian Carnes 2002/10/15)
       </p>

       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: When an exception is thrown but not caught in a sub-thread,
       this exception is not passed to the main thread by the operating
       system. Rather, if the exception is not caught from the function that
       was invoked by the spawning system function, the entire program is
       terminated without an additional message. The wrapper functions which
       are used to spawn new threads in the <code>Threads</code>
       namespace therefore now catch these exceptions and at least print the
       message they carry, before aborting the program. This way, at least the
       message gets displayed.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The class <code
       class="member">Table&lt;2&gt;::fill</code> function, which is also
       inherited from the <code>FullMatrix</code> class, used to
       work also when the size of the matrix was zero, by simply not copying
       something. This led to difficult to detect errors. It is therefore no
       more allowed to call this function when the matrix is empty. For all
       other cases, the status of copying without checking the size of the
       array copied from remains unchanged.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The classes <code
       class="class">TableIndices&lt;N&gt;</code> and <code
       class="class">Table&lt;N,T&gt;</code> are now implemented also
       for <code>N=4,5</code> and <code>6</code>. The <code
       class="class">Table&lt;N,T&gt;</code> class represents an
       <code>N</code>-dimensional array and might replace the
       N-times-nested-use of the <code

       <br>
       (RH 2002/09/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>Threads::n_existing_threads</code>
       function returns the present number of existing threads, allowing an
       assessment whether it is useful to spawn new threads or rather perform
       the operation in question sequentially.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Global exception class <code
       class="class">ExcIteratorPastEnd</code>, which should be used if an
       iterator is incremented or decremented beyond its end value.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Extended: Previously, the <code
       class="class">Threads::PosixThreadBarrier</code>
       class could not be used at all (they threw exceptions), if your system
       did not have the respective POSIX functions. This restriction is lifted
       for the special case that you give one as the number of parties that
       will be waiting for the barrier: in this case, a barrier is a
       no-operation, so we do not need assistence from the operating
       system. This change makes it slightly simpler to write programs in a way
       such that they run in both single- and multithreaded environments.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The old class <code>vector2d</code>, implementing a
       two-dimensional array of objects is now gone. Instead, there is the new
       <code>Table</code> class that implements tables of
       arbitrary dimension. Transition is painless: where there was
       <code>vector2d&lt;type&gt;</code> before, use
       <code>Table&lt;2,type&gt;</code> now (and don't forget to update the
       name of the header file, of course). If you have a three-dimensional
       array, you can use <code>Table&lt;3,type&gt;</code> now.

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: In EPS output, colors were set to invalid values if the
       values of the field that is used for coloring are all
       equal. This happens, for example, in the very first time step
       of time dependent problems, if initial values are zero. The
       color value now used is arbitrary, but valid.

  <li><p>
       Changed: In an attempt to unify the use of preconditioners a
       little, the function <code>initialize</code> of
       classes <code>PreconditionRelaxation</code> and
       <code>PreconditionBlock</code> take an argument
       of type <code>AdditionalData</code>, defined in
       the same class.  Standard behavior of <code
       class="class">PreconditionBlock</code> has been changed on this
       occasion to invert diagonal blocks during initialization.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/01/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The interface for sparse decompositions has been abstracted, and
       there is now an Modified Incomplete Cholesky (MIC) decomposition in
       addition to the Incomplete LU (ILU) decomposition.
       <br>
       (Stephen Kolaroff 2002/11/27)
       </p>
 
  <li> <p>
       Changed: In multithread mode, the <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix</code> would spawn
       <code>multithread_info.n_default_threads</code> threads to
       perform matrix-vector multiplications and similar
       operations. It would even do so if
       <code>multithread_info.n_default_threads</code> was equal to
       one. In that case, we now do the operation on the thread we are
       presently on, eliminating the overhead of spawning a single
       thread, and later waiting and terminating it.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/11/13)
       </p>
 
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: In the <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class, wrapping 
       the MA27 solver written in Fortran77 into some structure amenable to C++,
       we wrote beyond the end of an array on rare inputs. This is now fixed. The
       same probably holds for the respective code for MA47.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Since the MA27 sparse direct solver uses Fortran common blocks, it
       was previously impossible to run several instances of this solver in
       parallel, in a multihreaded environment. To solve this problem, the
       <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class now has a detached
       mode, in which it forks off a separate program that will do the
       computations using this solver. The actual operations are therefore
       distributed to distint programs that have separate address spaces. This
       allows to have as many concurrent instances of this solver in parallel
       as you want. For more information, read the documentation of the 
       <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The classes <code
       class="class">PreconditionBlock</code>, <code
       class="class">PreconditionBlockJacobi</code>, <code
       class="class">PreconditionBlockSOR</code>, and <code
       class="class">PreconditionBlockSSOR</code> have changed their
       template signature. The first template argument is now the matrix
       type, not just a number type.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Class <code>BlockVector</code> has a
       function <code>collect_sizes()</code>, very much as
       <code>BlockSparsityPattern</code>. This allows
       updating internal structures after blocks have been resized.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Class <code>SparseMatrix</code> has an
       STL-conforming <code>const_iterator</code> and
       functions <code>begin()</code> and <code
       class="member">end()</code> for looping through all existing
       entries. Furthermore, <code>begin(row)</code> and
       <code>end(row)</code> allow looping through all
       entries of a single line.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Classes <code>SparsityPattern</code> and <code
       class="class">SparseMatrix</code> now have functions <code 
       class="member">block_write/block_read</code>, allowing to dump the data
       of these objects into a file in binary format, and later to re-read it
       without much need for parsing.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>Vector</code> has a function <code
       class="member">lp_norm</code>, computing the <i>l<sub>p</sub></i>-norm
       of a vector for arbitrary <i>p</i>.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: a way of using abstract base classes for matrices has
       been implemented with <code>PointerMatrixBase</code>
       and <code>PointerMatrix</code>. Storing a matrix in
       <code>PointerMatrix</code> allows to use the base
       class in functions only templated for the vector class.

<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The restriction matrices for the Q1 element in 1d had a
       trivial bug in that one element was not set. Due to the fact
       that contributions from all child cells are taken into account,
       this did no harm, though, since all computations were done
       correctly anyway.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/05/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>GeometryInfo</code> classes now
       have new static member functions <code
       class="member">child_cell_from_point</code> that, given a point
       in the unit cell, returns which child cell it is on; <code
       class="member">cell_to_child_coordinates</code> that transforms
       coordinates between the unit coordinate systems from the mother
       to the child cell; <code
       class="member">child_to_cell_coordinates</code> that does
       exactly the opposite; and <code
       class="member">is_inside_unit_cell</code> that tells whether a 
       given point is inside the unit cell.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/05/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code
       class="member">recursively_set/clear_user_pointer</code> that
       do much the same as  <code
       class="member">recursively_set/clear_user_flag</code> on a
       line/quad/hex and all of its descendants, but on user pointers
       rather than flags.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/04/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The functions in the <code
       class="class">DerivativeApproximation</code> class can now also
       work on <code>BlockVector</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/04/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The cell argument to <code
       class="member">Mapping::transform_unit_to_real_cell</code> (and its
       reverse function) is now passed by reference, rather than by value, for
       efficiency reasons.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/04/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code
       class="member">GridGenerator::subdivided_hyper_cube</code> generated a
       hypercube as coarse grid that is subdivided a given number of times.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOut_DoFData::merge_patches</code>
       function allows to merge the patches of two objects, so as to create one
       output file from several DoF handlers. This is useful if one uses a
       domain decomposition algorithm where each block of the domain is
       represented by one DoF handler.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DataOutStack</code> class had a problem
       when there were as many degrees of freedom as there were cells (i.e. if
       we were using DG0 elements). This should now be fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/03/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DataOutFaces</code> class was
       broken for cell data. It should now be correct, although the
       algorithm used is not optimal, being approximately quadratic in
       runtime.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>ConstraintMatrix::shift</code>
       function shifts and translates the elements of the constraint
       matrix by a certain number of indices.
       <br>
       (Roy Stogner 2003/02/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>GridReordering</code> class now uses a
       vastly better algorithm in 2d than previously. The new algorithm is
       linear in time, where it could be exponential before.
       <br>
       (Michael Anderson 2003/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function <code
       class="member">GridIn::read_xda</code> that allows reading
       grids from a file in XDA format.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Some implementation details of the <code
       class="class">GridReordering</code> class have been moved to a
       namespace <code>internal</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::prolongation_is_implemented</code> and
       <code>FiniteElement::constraints_are_implemented</code>
       that inform the caller about whether the finite element in question in
       fact implements its prolongation matrices and hanging node constraints.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">ConstraintMatrix::is_identity_constrained</code> function
       would previously generate a segmentation fault if called on a constraint
       matrix object that did not contain any constraints at all. This is now
       fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Objects of type <code>FESystem</code> 
       could not be constructed if one of the elements it is to be composed of
       did not implement interface constraints for hanging nodes. This is now
       fixed: you can construct such a composed element, but it does not
       implement hanging node constraints either.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/02/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: For each of the renumbering functions in the <code
       class="class">DoFRenumbering</code> class there is now an
       additional <code>compute_*</code>
       function. These new functions compute and return the
       corresponding renumbering vectors but do not perform the actual
       renumbering on the <code>DoFHandler</code>
       object. The behaviour of the old functions is not changed.
       <br>
       (RH 2003/02/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>GridReordering</code> tried to be
       thread-safe in the initialization of some data, but was not due to a
       typo. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code>FEValues::get_cell</code> and
       <code>FEValues::get_face</code> functions have
       been removed, since they limited our ability to use this
       class for other types of DoFHandlers, for example future
       extensions for hp elements.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/01/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The DoF accessor classes now have a function <code
       class="member">get_fe()</code> that returns a reference to the finite
       element being used on this cell. The result is of course identical to
       what a call to <code
       class="member">iterator-&gt;get_dof_handler().get_fe()</code> would have
       yielded.

  <li> <p> 
       New: Checked in new <code>GridGenerator</code> 
       member function <code>half_hyper_ball</code>,
       derived from member <code>hyper_ball</code>.     
       The initial mesh contains four elements. This mesh will work with
       the boundary class <code>HalfHyperBallBoundary</code>.

       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Checked in new class <code>FE_Q_Hierarchical</code>
       derived from class <code>FiniteElement</code>.  
       This element is analogous to <code>FE_Q</code>, but 
       makes use of hierarchical shape functions, based on the 
       <code>Polynomials::Hierarchical</code> class. 
       For <code>degree&gt;1</code>, the non-nodal basis functions are "bubble"
       functions, which are not Lagrange polynomials. Therefore, the usual
       interpolation based on using unit support points will not work for
       <code>degree&gt;1</code>. It is planned to implement a different
       interpolation-projection operator, based on an hp-type interpolant.
       <br>
       The files for this element are
       <code>deal.II/include/fe/fe_q_hierarchical.h</code> and 
       <code>deal.II/source/fe/fe_q_hierarchical.cc</code>.
       <br>
       (Brian Carnes 2002/12/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: For finite element classes, the functions
       <code>unit_support_point</code> and
       <code>unit_face_support_point</code> return the position
       of an individual support point. This is necessary when you want to get
       information about the support points of certain components in a composed
       finite element, where not all components provide support points, and the
       composed element thus does not fill the array the 
       <code>get_unit_support_points</code> function returns.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/11/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: Vectors could not be given as input and output vectors to the
       <code>SolutionTransfer</code> class at the same time, but
       this was not checked. An assertion has now been added to ensure this
       requirement. 
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">DoFRenumbering::component_wise</code> function accepts a
       parameter indicating the order in which the degrees of freedom
       corresponding to one vector component are to be sorted. However, it did
       not honor this order, but always sorted them in the order in which the
       components appear. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::system_to_base_index</code> function now
       exports the values of the <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::system_to_base_table</code> member
       variable. Likewise for the indices on faces.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::element_multiplicity</code> function was
       previously only available in the <code>FESystem</code>
       class, where it actually returned a non-trivial value. However, in some
       cases one would need to access this field also for general finite
       elements, even if the returned value will be equal to one in all cases
       other than a composed element.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The algorithm to generate neighbor information for patches from
       cells in <code>DataOut::build_patches</code> was rather
       inefficient, tripling the time for patch generation when support for
       neighbor information was added. Furthermore, the algorithm was at least
       O(N log N), where the rest was all O(N), making this particularly
       problematic when the data set was already large. This should now be back
       to the previous level, by using a more efficient algorithm.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/10/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed (internals): Previously, the finite element base class
       initialized the restriction, prolongation, and face constraints matrices
       to their correct size. Derived classes had to fill these classes, and
       should have set their size back to zero in case they chose not to
       implement them. However, we found a class that forgot to resize it to
       zero, so it is now the other way round: they remain at size zero, and a
       class that chooses to implement these matrices has to set them to the
       correct size, to avoid programs that run on data that as just been
       forgotten to add. (This information only concerns programs that
       implement some finite element class on their own.)
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: The different transfer functions in <code
       class="class">FETools</code> operate on template vector arguments.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: the class <code
       class="class">FE_DGPNonparametric</code> implements finite elements
       where shape functions are polynomials of order <i>k</i> on the
       actual grid cell. This is achieved by evaluating the polynomials at
       the mapped quadrature points. No grid transfer matrices are
       available for this class.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/09/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: Some of the various instances of the <code
       class="member">VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values</code> functions
       were not explicitly instantiated, leading to linker errors. This is now
       fixed. 
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Removed: The <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::component_to_system_index</code> function
       and its counterpart for faces is gone. This data did not make much sense
       in the case of elements that are non-zero in more than one vector
       component, such as the Nedelec element. The respective information can
       also be obtained from other sources provided by the finite element
       classes, if so necessary.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">FiniteElement::restriction_is_additive</code> function
       used to take an argument that denoted the vector component of a finite
       element. This has become difficult with elements that are non-zero in
       more than one vector component, such as the Nedelec element. Thus, the
       semantics of the function have been changed so that the argument now
       denotes the index of a shape function, rather than a vector
       component. Since the function is probably not used in application code,
       this will most probably not lead to more serious problems.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The mapping classes now also know how to transform tensors of rank
       2, not only vectors (tensors of rank 1) in a co- and contravariant way.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/09/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: the <code>GridIn</code> class had problems
       when reading in UCD grids with comment lines that contained
       only the comment sign, but nothing else. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/08/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Improved: <code>VectorTools</code>::<code
       class="member">integrate_difference</code> can compute <i>L<sup>p</sup></i>
       and <i>W<sup>1,p</sup></i> norms for arbitrary <i>p</i>. The function
       receives an additional optional argument <i>p</i> for this. All previous
       fuctionality remains unchanged, although the code has been cleaned up a bit.
       <br>
       (GK 2002/08/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>GridTools</code> class now
       offers functions to apply general transformations to all
       vertices of a triangulation, and also more specialized
       functions that shift, scale, and rotate triangulations.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/07/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The existing <code
       class="member">FETools::extrapolate</code> functions does not
       take into account hanging node constraints. Therefore, it works
       for continuous elements on globally refined grids and on
       discontinuous elements, only. Now, there is a new <code
       class="member">FETools::extrapolate</code> function with an
       additional <code>ConstraintMatrix</code> argument
       for the hanging node constraints. This new function works for
       continuous as well as for discontinuous elements. But, the old
       function is still supported.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/17)

  <li> <p> New: There are now <code
       class="member">Triangulation::save/load_user_pointers(vector&lt;void
       *&gt; &amp;)</code> functions similar to the respective <code
       class="member">Triangulation::save/load_user_flags(vector&lt;bool&gt;
       &amp;)</code> functions.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: Bug in <code
       class="member">Triangulation<3>::load_user_flags(vector&lt;bool&gt;
       &amp;)</code> is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: <code
       class="member">Triangulation::load_user_flags(vector&lt;bool&gt;
       &amp;)</code> erroneously threw an assertion for
       <code>dim==1</code>. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: <code
       class="member">Triangulation<1>::n_quads</code> now returns 0,
       instead of throwing an assertion, as before. The same holds for
       similar functions like <code
       class="member">Triangulation&lt;dim&gt;::n_hexs</code> that now
       returns 0 for <code>dim<3</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: Several functions like the <code
       class="member">DoFHandler::distribute_dofs</code> and <code
       class="member">DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern</code>
       functions altered the <code
       class="member">user_flags</code>. This was stated in the
       documentation of these functions. Nevertheless, it might have
       led to unexpected behaviour of the <code
       class="member">user_flags</code> for users who weren't aware of
       this <em>side-effect</em>. Now, these functions do not alter
       the <code>user_flags</code>, any
       more. Consequently, the users do not need to worry any more
       about the reliability of the <code
       class="member">user_flags</code> when calling any function of
       the library.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/14)
       </p>  

  <li> <p> Fixed: <code
       class="member">FE_Q::has_support_on_face</code> always returned
       true in 1d, partly because faces are not really an issue in
       1d. It now does so only when the support point of the
       respective shape function is actually the requested vertex. The
       same applied to <code
       class="member">FE_DGQ::has_support_on_face</code>
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The existing <code
       class="member">FETools::interpolate</code>, <code
       class="member">FETools::back_interpolate</code> and <code
       class="member">FETools::interpolate_difference</code> functions
       do not take into account hanging node constraints. Therefore,
       they work for continuous elements on globally refined grids and
       on discontinuous elements, only. Now, there are new functions
       with the same names but additional <code
       class="class">ConstraintMatrix</code> arguments for the hanging
       node constraints. These new functions work for continuous as
       well as for discontinuous elements. But, the old functions are
       still supported.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The constructor of <code
       class="class">DoFHandler</code> now takes a reference to a
       <code>const</code> <code>Triangulation</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The constructors of all <code
       class="class">DoFAccessor</code>, <code
       class="class">TriaAccessor</code> and <code
       class="class">TriaIterator</code> classes now take pointers to
       <tt>const</tt> <code>Triangulation</code>s.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: In debug mode the <code
       class="member">MappingQ1::transform_real_to_unit_cell</code>
       function erroneously threw an assertion when used in 1 or 3
       dimensions. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2002/06/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Fixed: The <code>get_dof_indices</code>
       functions of DoF accessor classes used to work also for
       non-active cells. However, the results were bogus except for
       the special case that we had a finite element that has all its
       degrees of freedom located in vertices. This is now fixed: the
       function throws an exception in all other cases, since there is
       no useful meaning for it then. It continues to work in the
       special case.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: For encapsulated postscript output of 2d grids, it is now
       possible to tell the <code>GridOut</code> class to
       write the cell numbers into each cell, as well as the numbers
       of the vertices.
       <br>
       (WB 2002/06/04)

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>
  <li> <p> Removed: All the matrix classes have functions <code>reinit</code> that are used to resize the
       matrix. However, the sparse matrix classes had an equally named
       function without arguments that basically left the size of the matrix
       unchanged but set all elements of the matrix to zero. It could also be
       abused to notify the matrix that the sparsity pattern on which it is
       built has changed, an inherently risky procedure. The no-argument code
       <code>reinit</code> function has therefore been removed to
       avoid confusion with the <code>reinit</code> functions
       that take arguments. Instead, you should now use <code>matrix=0</code> to simply set all elements of the
       matrix to zero. If you want to notify a sparse matrix that its sparsity
       pattern has changed, use the <code>reinit(SparsityPattern)</code> function.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Removed: All the vector and block vector classes as well as
       the <code>FullMatrix</code> class (the latter
       through its <code>Table</code> base class) had a
       member function <code>clear</code> which simply
       resets all values of the vector or matrix to zero. It did not
       change the size of the object, though. This was confusing,
       since the standard C++ container classes implement the
       semantics that the <code>clear</code> functions
       delete all entries of the containers, i.e. resize it to zero,
       and we implemented similar semantics also for the <code>SparseMatrix</code>, <code>DoFHandler</code>, <code>ConstraintMatrix</code> and various other
       classes.
       <br>
       To avoid this confusion in the future, the <code>clear</code> functions have been dropped from
       the interface of the vector and full matrix classes, and the
       remaining instances where deal.II classes have a function of
       that name really mean that the object is reset to its virginal
       state. To set all
       elements of a matrix or vector to zero without changing its size, the
       recommended way is to use the more obvious notation <code>vector=0</code> and <code>matrix=0</code>. To
       reset the elements of a table over arbitrary objects, use
       <code>Table&lt;T&gt;::reset_values()</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Removed: The <code>SparseLUDecomposition::reinit</code> and <code>SparseMIC::reinit</code> functions without
       argument had been deprecated before, and have now been removed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: the template parameter of <code>MGTransferPrebuilt</code> is now the complete vector
       type, not just the value type of the vector. This allows to operate
       on <code>Vector</code> as well as on <code
       class="class">BlockVector</code>. Unfortunately, the untested class
       <code>MGTransferBlock</code> underwent some more
       changes without testing, such that it should be used with high
       caution.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/04/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code>FiniteElement</code> classes had a
       function <code>restrict</code> that returns the
       restriction matrix from children to the mother cell. Unfortunately,
       <code>restrict</code> has become a keyword in recent standards of the C
       language, and some C++ compilers have picked this up. The function has
       therefore been renamed <code
       class="member">get_restriction_matrix</code>, which also better
       reflects what it is actually doing. To keep consistent, we have also
       rename the corresponding function <code>prolongate</code> to <code>get_prolongation_matrix</code>. 
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed and changed: The <code>SolutionTransfer</code><code>::(refine_)interpolate(const Vector &in, Vector
       &out)</code> functions now require the <code>in</code> and <code>out</code>
       vectors being already of right sizes,
       i.e. <code>in.size()=n_dofs_old</code> and
       <code>out.size()=n_dofs_refined</code>. Furthermore, the <code>SolutionTransfer</code><code>::(refine_)interpolate(const
       vector&lt;Vector&gt; &all_in, vector&lt;Vector&gt;
       &all_out)</code> now check that the number of in and output
       vectors are the same, i.e.
       <code>all_in.size()=all_out.size()</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2003/10/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>QProjector</code> has functions that
       project a lower-dimensional quadrature formula onto all faces or
       subfaces of a cell. In 3d, it now does this but also adds projections of
       these quadrature formula onto the faces from the other side. We need
       this due to the fact that we now support faces in 3d that have a normal
       vector opposite to the standard direction.
       <br> 
       (WB 2003/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Moved and changed: The header file
       <tt>include/numerics/dof_renumbering.h</tt> has been moved to the 
       directory <tt>include/dofs</tt>, where it logically
       belongs. Furthermore, the sorting parameter of the function <code>DoFRenumbering</code><code>::component_wise</code> has changed its meaning. See
       the reference documentation for details.

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p> New: After the documentation tool for deal.II has been
  changed to <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>, it is delivered in two
  tar-files. Additional to the traditional source tarball, the preprocessed
  documentation is available ready for reading with a web browser.
  <br>
  (GK 2004/05/04)
  </p>

  <li> <p> New:
       The step-15 example is about solving a nonlinear 1d problem, and
       dealing with transporting a solution across mesh refinement. Step-16 is
       still not finished.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/04/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New:
       The step-17 example program shows how to use the new PETSc wrapper
       classes, and how to do large-scale computations with up to many
       millions of unknowns on a cluster of computers. This program shows
       that deal.II is well-suited for truly massive parallel
       computations. The step-15 and step-16 programs have not yet been
       finished (despite having been started long before step-17), which
       explains the holes in the numbering of example programs.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/04/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: deal.II is now able to interface to the 
       <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/metis/index.html"
       target="_top">METIS</a> library to generate domain partitionings. This
       is enabled if a METIS installation is detected, which either happens
       automatically in <code>./configure</code>, or
       by passing a value to the switch <code>--with-metis</code> to configure
       the path of a METIS installation. For more information see the README
       file. 
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: We now support MIPSpro compiler version 7.41 from SGI. deal.II
       now runs on IRIX64 machines in 64-bit mode.
       <br>
       Please note, that we cannot support earlier MIPSpro compilers
       because the compiler version 7.3 was not C++ standard
       conforming. Version 7.4 is standard conforming but still too
       buggy.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: deal.II now comes with a complete set of
       wrappers classes for <a href="http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/"
       target="_top">PETSc</a> vectors, matrices, linear solvers and 
       preconditioners. Many of the algorithms in deal.II have also been
       updated to make use of these wrappers. All of this is only enabled if a
       PETSc installation is detected. This either happens automatically in
       <code>./configure</code>, or
       by passing values to the switches <code>--with-petsc</code> and
       <code>--with-petsc-arch</code> to configure path and architecture of an
       existing PETSc installation. If these switches are not used, then
       environment variables are searched for this information. For more
       information see the README file.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The part of the boost library in the <tt>contrib</tt>
       directory is now updated to boost version 1-30.2. We include
       only a minimal part (about 3% in size) of boost which is needed
       to compile deal.II. For the case the compilation of deal.II on
       some compiler/platforms requires boost files in addition to
       those included in the <tt>contrib</tt> directory please report
       the missing boost files to the deal.II mailing list.
       <br> 
       (RH 2004/02/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: We don't support compilation by Intel'c icc compiler version 5
       anymore. Since the present version of this compiler is 8, this is
       probably not a real problem.
       <br> 
       (WB 2003/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>step-9</code> had the computation of the value of the
       solution in the mid-point of the neighbor cell wrong. This is now
       fixed. Consequently, the resulting mesh also looks much nicer now (much
       smoother). 
       <br> 
       (<a href="mailto:werner.scholz@tuwien.ac.at">Werner Scholz</a>
        2003/12/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>config.h</code> file now declares a variable <code
       class="member">deal_II_numbers::invalid_unsigned_int</code>.
       It is a representation of the largest number that can be put into an
       unsigned integer. This value is widely used throughout the library as a
       marker for an invalid unsigned integer value, such as an invalid array
       index, an invalid array size, and the like.
       <br> 
       (WB 2003/10/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Augmented: The <code
       class="member">GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face</code> 
       results in a result that might not be what you expect in 3d in some
       cases. A warning has been added to the documentation, as well as a
       reference to the function to call instead.
       <br> 
       (WB 2003/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The step-14 program had a bug in the rare case that
       there are more CPUs in a machine than there are cells. This is
       now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: In the step-14 example program, overly conservative
       quadrature formulas were chosen (with 2N+1 quadrature points per space
       dimension, where N is the degree of polynomials). This is unnecessary,
       and now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: On AIX systems, the xlf Fortran77 compiler wasn't recognized 
       due to the fact that when called with -v it generates many pages
       of output, later leading to a shell error. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The elastic example program, step-8, had a bug in the way
       the system matrix is assembled. In effect, we were solving the
       wrong equation. This should now be fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: When building with both sparse direct solver MA27 and the
       TECPLOT libraries, the <code>detached_ma27</code> would not
       link properly. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The script that builds the dependency lists for Makefiles
       has been rewritten in C++, since the previous perl script
       became just too slow after the addition of parts of
       BOOST. Using the old perl script should still work, although it
       simply forwards to the new program. In order to use the new
       one, simply replace the line
       <code><pre>
         \$(PERL) \$D/common/scripts/make_dependencies.pl ...
       </pre></code>
       by
       <code><pre>
         \$D/common/scripts/make_dependencies ...
       </pre></code>
       i.e. call the program directly without the perl interpreter and
       without the file extension for a perl program.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/08/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: First steps to a migration of the documentation from
       <tt>kdoc</tt> to <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> have
       been done. It can be generated after installing <a
       href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a> by calling <tt>make</tt>
       in <tt>doc/doxygen</tt> and using the preliminary link page <a
       href="../doxygen/index.html">index.html</a> in that directory.

<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> 
       New: There is now a new <code>PolynomialsP</code>
       class which is based on <code>Polynomials::Monomial</code> and <code>PolynomialSpace</code>. In contrast to the
       default ordering of the polynomials in <code>PolynomialSpace</code>, (e.g. for degree=2) <i>1,
       x, x<sup>2</sup>, y, xy, y<sup>2</sup></i>, the <code>PolynomialsP</code> class now gives the
       (natural?!)  ordering <i>1, x, y, xy, x<sup>2</sup>,
       y<sup>2</sup></i>.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The classes <code>PolynomialSpace</code> and
       <code>TensorProductPolynomials</code> now have
       new <code>set_numbering</code> functions which
       allow to change the ordering of the polynomials. The ordering
       and the indices of the polynomials kann be checked by using the
       new <code>output_indices</code> functions.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The class <code>PolynomialsBDM</code> implements BDM polynomials in
       two dimensions on the unit square. It was implemented as is
       according to some urgent need, but should be suitable to be fit
       into a <code>FiniteElement</code> similar to
       Raviart/Thomas.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/01/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Objects of type <code>Polynomial</code>
       can now be added to and subtracted from each other through
       operators <code>+=</code> and <code>-=</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/12/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There is now a class <code>QuadratureSelector</code> that allows to select a
       quadrature formula based on a string argument and possibly a
       number indicating the order of the formula.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2003/10/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The constructor of the <code>QGauss</code> class
       computed positions and weights of quadrature points in long double accuracy.
       However, on machines where long double is the same as double, it 
       never reached the requested accuracy, in effect leading to an infinite loop.
       This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>Function</code> class now
       exports the value of its template argument through the static
       member variable <code>dimension</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code>ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> function
       now allows to redeclare an entry that has already been
       declared. This can be used to override a default value
       previously set.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The <code>ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> function now takes an
       additional parameter (defaulting to the empty string) that can be used
       to document the intent of a parameter. This string, together with the
       default value of an entry, is written to the output by the <code>ParameterHandler::print_parameters</code> function that
       can be used to generate a virginial parameter file, or one that contains
       the settings of all parameters used in a computation.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code>ParameterHandler::declare_entry</code> previously
       returned a value indicating whether the just-declared entry didn't
       already existed and that the default value matches the given
       pattern. However, this value could only always be true since these two
       conditions were already guarded by assertions in the implementation at
       least in debug mode, so the return value was meaningless. The function
       has now no return type any more.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>Logstream</code>::<code>depth_console</code>, <code>Logstream</code>::<code>depth_file</code>, <code>Logstream</code>::<code>log_execution_time</code> and <code>Logstream</code>::<code>log_time_differences</code> return the previous value.

<ol>
  <li> <p> Improved: The matrix-vector operations of <code>SparseMatrix</code> accept arguments of type <code>BlockVector</code>.
  <br>
  (GK/2004/03/31)
  </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>SparseMatrix</code> iterator classes
       had various interesting bugs when rows of the matrix were completely
       empty. These should now be fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>SparsityPattern</code> class now also
       has an iterator class that allows to walk over all nonzero entries of a
       sparsity pattern.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The iterator classes into <code>SparseMatrix</code> have been rearranged and extended, so
       that it is now also possible to write to individual matrix entries
       through these iterators.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>Vector</code> and <code>BlockVector</code> classes now have member functions
       <code>is_non_negative</code> that check whether a vector
       has no negative entries.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>SolverMinRes</code> class had a nasty bug where we were
       inadvertently copying vectors; this could also have led to a memory
       corruption bug. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There is now a function <code>FullMatrix::add_scaled</code>. It replaces the old
       function <code>FullMatrix::add</code> which did the same,
       but had a name that was incompatible with respective functions in the
       other matrix classes.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: <code>FullMatrix</code> has new functions <code>add</code> and ,<code>Tadd</code>
       allowing to add to a selected block of the matrix.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/02/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>Vector</code> class now has operators to compare for
       equality and inequality.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>SparseMatrix::operator()</code> generated an assertion
       failure if the requested entry in the matrix isn't there. This has been
       changed so that it actually throws an exception instead, also in
       optimized mode.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There is now a function <code>SparseMatrix::frobenius_norm</code> that computes the
       Frobenius norm of a sparse matrix.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: In matrix-vector operations of the <code>Full/SparseMatrix</code> classes, source and destination
       cannot be the same. We now also check that this is indeed the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/01/26)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> Improved: Initialization routines of class <code>SparseMatrix</code> have an additional parameter
       controlling the storage of diagonal entries.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/11/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: 
       <code>SolverFGMRES</code> implements the flexible
       GMRES method with varying preconditioner from the right. It is
       also accessible in <code>SolverSelector</code> by choosing <tt>fgmres</tt>.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/10/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The <code>SparseDirectMA27</code>
       class used to store a pointer to the sparsity pattern of the
       matrix. It now releases this as soon as it doesn't need it any
       more.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: Some of the member matrix-vector functions of the
       <code>BlockSparseMatrix</code> class that
       previously could only be used with arguments of type <code>BlockVector</code> can now also be used with the
       usual <code>Vector</code> class provided the
       block matrix has only one block row or column.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: <code>FullMatrix</code>::<code>copy_from</code> didn't compile when copying
       from a sparse matrix. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2003/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The classes <code>FullMatrix</code> and
       <code>PreconditionBlockJacobi</code> have a <code>const_iterator</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/07/18)
       </p>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p> Improved: The <code>DoFTools::compute_Cuthill_McKee</code> function
       needs to build a sparsity pattern for its operations, and uses
       the <code>DoFHandler::max_couplings_per_dof</code>
       function for this. However, the estimates returned by the
       latter function are rather bad in 3d, leading to excessive
       memory allocation in the Cuthill McKee algorithm in 3d. This is
       fixed by using an intermediate compressed sparsity pattern
       instead if we are in 3d.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/05/18)
  </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>Triangulation</code> has
       functions <code>n_faces</code> and <code>n_active_faces</code>, globally as well as by level,
       similar to <code>n_cells</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/05/18)
  </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Added support for <a href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/"
       target="_top">gmsh</a> mesh format in <code>GridIn::read_msh</code>.
       <br>
       (Luca Heltai 2004/04/21)
       </p>
              
  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>GridGenerator::cylinder_shell</code> generates a domain
       of the type which the name suggests.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/04/19)
       </p>
              
  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>KellyErrorEstimator::estimate</code> function takes an
       additional parameter that lets it only compute error indicators for a
       certain subdomain. This is meant to allow for a better parallelization
       of efforts in parallel programs.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/04/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code>MGTransferSelect</code> uses target components
       correctly. Unfortunately, the untested class <code>MGTransferBlock</code> does not work anymore. Since its
       usefulness was not clear anyway, this state may continue for a while.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/04/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code>FE_Poly</code>
       class which is templatized for polynomial spaces like <code>TensorProductPolynomials</code>, <code>PolynomialSpace</code> or <code>PolynomialsP</code>. Many finite element classes
       are now derived from this class and the implementation of all
       common functionality is now moved from these finite element
       classes to <code>FE_Poly</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/03/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new function <code>MatrixTools::local_apply_boundary_values</code> folds
       boundary value information into local matrices and vectors before they
       are written into the global matrix and vector. This way, the final call
       to  <code>MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code> can
       be avoided.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: There are now functions <code>ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global</code> that
       take a local matrix or vector and distribute it to a global one, but
       taking care of constrained degrees of freedom; in that case, the
       respective entries are already distributed to the final place in the
       global matrix or vector. That way, the final call to the <code>ConstraintMatrix::condense</code> function can be
       avoided.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new functions <code>SparsityPattern::partition</code>, <code>GridTools::partition_triangulation</code>, <code>DoFTools::get_subdomain_association</code>, <code>DoFTools::count_dofs_with_subdomain_association</code>,
       <code>GridTools::get_subdomain_association</code>, <code>GridTools::count_cells_with_subdomain_association</code>, 
       and <code>DoFRenumbering::subdomain_wise</code> can now
       be used to generate partitions of a triangulation and its associated
       degrees of freedom suitable for parallel computations with PETSc.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: When eliminating nodes from a matrix using the <code>ConstraintMatrix::condense</code> functions, the
       diagonal entry was set to one. It is now set to an entry that more
       resembles the size of the other diagonal entries, so that we don't run
       into scaling problems for applications that have very large or small
       domains.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The classes <code>DataOut*</code> and <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code> have been generalized to take
       more and different vector types as input parameters. In particular,
       they now take normal and block vectors over doubles and floats, as well
       as PETSc vectors if PETSc support is detected during configuration of
       the library.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: The template parameter of the functions in the <code>GridRefinement</code> class have been changed. Where they
       previously denoted the type over which the <code>Vector</code> class is to be templated, they now mean the
       actual vector class. Thus, they can be any other template class as long
       as there are suitable operations defined over them. In addition,
       the documentation stated that they must be vectors of floats; this
       hasn't been true any more for quite a while already, and is duly
       removed from the documentation.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/02/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function
       <code>FETools::project_dg</code>
       performs <i>L<sup>2</sup></i>-projections between finite element spaces
       of different degrees on the same mesh.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>FiniteElementData</code> has a function
       <code>tensor_degree()</code>, returning the degree of the
       polynomial space suitable for choosing a tensor product quadrature
       formula. 
       <br>
       (GK 2003/11/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Long requested but never implemented before in the
       library: there is now a function <code>GridTool::find_active_cell_around_point</code>
       that, given a point, finds the active cell in which this point
       lies.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/10/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>MGCoarseGridHouseholder</code>
       implements a coarse grid solver using QR-factorization.
       <br>
       (GK 2003/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>FEFaceValuesBase::boundary_form</code>
       function was declared but not implemented. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (J&ouml;rg R. Weimar 2003/10/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>MatrixCreator::create_mass_matrix</code>
       functions are now templatized also on the template argument of
       the <code>SparseMatrix</code> class. This allows
       invoking this function for <code>SparseMatrix&lt;double&gt;</code> and <code>SparseMatrix&lt;float&gt;</code> objects.
       <br>
       (RH 2003/10/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now also a function <code>MGDoFCellAccessor::neighbor_child_on_subface</code>
       that returns the result of the <code>CellAccessor::neighbor_child_on_subface</code>
       function but converts it so that one can also access MGDoF
       data.
       <br>
       (RH 2003/10/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code>CellAccessor::neighbor_child_on_subface</code> and <code>DoFCellAccessor::neighbor_child_on_subface</code>
       that should be called instead of using <code>GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face</code> in most cases.
       <br> 
       (WB 2003/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <code>GridGenerator</code> has a new
       function <code>subdivided_hyper_rectangle</code> 
       which generates a rectangle with given corner points and possibly 
       different numbers of subdivisions in different directions.
       Use it, e.g., to generate a domain of 1*4 length units
       with square cells.
       <br> 
       (Joerg Weimar 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The 3d grid reordering code in the <code>GridReordering</code> class now uses an algorithm
       that is linear in the number of elements. The old code was
       exponential, so this is a vast improvement.
       <br> 
       (Michael Anderson 2003/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>GridOut</code> has a an improved
       functionality for <code>write_eps</code> 
       to color the grid according to the refinement level.
       A corresponding option is included in 
       <code>GridOutFlags::Eps<2></code>.
       <br> 
       (Joerg Weimar 2003/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>TriaAccessor</code>::<code>point_inside</code> function is now also
       implemented in 3d.
       <br>
       (Joerg Weimar, WB 2003/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>TriaAccessor</code>::<code>recursively_set_material_id</code> function sets
       the material id of the present cell and of all its children,
       grandchildren, etc to the given value.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/09/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code>FETools</code>::<code>get_fe_from_name</code> function can do the
       reverse of the <code>FiniteElement</code>::<code>get_name</code> function: it takes a string and
       parses it to regenerate a finite element from it. Useful for
       parsing finite element names from input files.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/07/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>DataOut_DoFData</code>::<code>merge_patches</code> now takes a second
       parameter that indicates a shift for each vertex of the given
       patches to be merged. This is sometimes nice if one wants to
       generate "exploded" views of a collection of subdomains. It is
       also templatized on the first argument, so can merge in some
       other <code>DataOut_DoFData</code> that create
       the same type of patches but are otherwise different.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>FETools</code>::<code>extrapolate</code> function operates on patches
       of cells, but didn't check whether the grid is at least refined
       once everywhere. If this was not the case, it would generate
       wrong results. It now checks for this, and if the grid has
       unrefined coarse grid cells, an exception is generated.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>FEFaceValuesBase</code> has a new
       function <code>orientation</code> accessing a unique
       and consistent orientation for each face.
       <br> 
       (GK 2003/06/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       Changed: Embedding and restriction matrices for intergrid transfer are
       now computed in the constructor of most elements, rather than taken from
       precomputed and tabulated values. This removes restrictions on which
       elements are available since the old tables were only precomputed for
       certain polynomial degrees and are now available for all.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code>get_interpolation_matrix</code>, with which they can
       compute interpolations between different finite elements. Most will use
       this to compute interpolations between finite elements of the same kind
       but different polynomial degrees. The <code>FETools::get_interpolation_matrix</code> makes use of
       this function if it implements the desired interpolation, and falls back
       to the old algorithm if this is not the case.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Finite elements got a function <code>get_name</code>, which can be used to identify a finite
       element by its name.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: Raviart-Thomas elements are now implemented in the <code>FE_RaviartThomas</code> class.
       <br>
       (WB 2003/06/09)
       </p>

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>

  <li> <p> Changed: The call <code
  class="class">MGTransferBlock</code>::<code
  class="member">build_matrices</code> and to the same function in
  derived classes receaves a <code>DoFHandler</code> as
  an additional argument. It is needed to prebuild the transfer
  between vectors and multigrid vectors, since the loop over all cells
  is to slow.
  <br>
  (GK 2004/08/27)
  </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, parallel PETSc matrices only took the sizes of the
       matrix and the number of rows to be stored locally as arguments. They
       chose the partitioning of columns to be the same as that for the
       rows. However, this does not work for non-quadratic parallel matrices,
       and leads to very hard to find errors. Therefore, all constructors and
       reinit functions of the parallel sparse matrix classes now take an
       additional argument indicating the partitioning of columns of the matrix.

  <li> <p>
       New: Support of shared libraries under Cygwin / Windows systems. Shared 
       libraries are used as default. To use, make sure the library path is included
       in your <code>PATH</code> environment variable.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2004/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Examples do not use obsolete classes
       <code>QGaussN</code> anymore.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/12/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Configuration scripts were changed to allow any file suffix for
       shared and static libraries to allow in the future the creation of dlls
       under cygwin.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2004/12/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Configuration now detects the Intel Fortran compiler and can set 
       compilation flags accordingly.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/11/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: deal.II 5.0.0 didn't work with the PETSc release 2.2.1 (which
       came out after we released version 5.0.0). This should now be fixed:
       deal.II can be linked against both PETSc 2.2.0 and 2.2.1.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/10/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The documentation generated by Doxygen now states the header
       file defining a class. Furthermore, all deal.II
       exceptions are listed as classes and will soon be found in the module
       <tt>Exceptions</tt>.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/09/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: configuration option <tt>--with-umfpack</tt> for using the 
       UMFPack version and enabling the class <code
       class="class">SparseDirectUMFPACK</code>, both included by
       Wolfgang.
       <br>
       Deal.II comes with its own copy of the <a
       href="http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/">UMFPACK</a>
       library, courtesy of its author. In order to use, follow the steps
       listed <a href="../readme.html#umfpack">here</a>. Note that UMFPACK
       comes with its own license; to use UMFPACK, please read the <a

       (GK 2004/08/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: None of the formulas in the step-8 tutorial program web
       page were visible. This is now fixed.

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>MultithreadInfo</code> class now also detects multiple
       processors on Mac OS X.
       <br> 
       (Helmut M&uuml;ller 2004/11/29)
  </p>

  <li> <p> 
       New: The <code>
       TableHandler::write_tex</code> now accepts the additional boolean
       argument <code>with_header</code> which is set to
       true by default and tells the function whether to add the latex 
       header and footer (i.e. the \\documentclass{...},
       \\begin{document} and \\end{document} stuff) to the table.<br> 
       In addition to this, there are two new members in the above class: 
       <code> TableHandler::tex_set_table_caption</code> and
       <code> TableHandler::tex_set_table_label</code> to
       add a caption and a label to the tex generated table.  
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2004/10/29)
  </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code
       class="member">DataOutBase&lt;2,3&gt;::write_tecplot</code>
       sometimes did not write the variable name <code>z</code> when
       only outputting faces of cells. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/10/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: a class template <code>VectorSlice</code>
       allows access to consecutive portions of a vector.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/09/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The classes <code
       class="class">TableIndices&lt;N&gt;</code> and <code
       class="class">Table&lt;N,T&gt;</code> are now implemented also
       for <code>N=7</code>. The <code
       class="class">Table&lt;N,T&gt;</code> class represents an
       <code>N</code>-dimensional array and might replace the
       N-times-nested-use of the <code
       class="class">std::vector</code> class. 
       <br>
       (RH 2004/08/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>TableIndices</code> now has
       operators that check for equality and inequality of objects.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: A class <code>PointerComparison</code> for comparing
       pointers that may or may not be of the same type.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: The <code
       class="class">ParameterHandler</code> class contained a remnant from
       back in 1997 when it was modeled after a similar class in DiffPack: it
       had a <code>status</code> flag that one could obtain via the <code
       class="member">ok</code> function. It was never really used for
       anything, and has thus finally been removed. The <code
       class="member">ok</code> is consequently gone as well.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: An object of the new <code
       class="class">ConditionalOStream</code> class allows to print
       to an output stream depending on a condition, which is active
       or not. This is particular useful for parallel computations
       when only one process should print to standard output, while in all
       other processes we simply want output suppressed.

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: PETSc had changed some of its interfaces in version 2.2.1, which
       prevented deal.II from working with it (it couldn't be compiled at
       all). We have added checks that make sure that it can now again be
       compiled with PETSc versions 2.1.6, 2.2.0, and 2.2.1.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/10/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: A class <code>PreconditionLU</code> which
       provides a wrapper to the complete LU decomposition
       preconditioner of PETSc. Furthermore a class 
       <code>SolverPreOnly</code> was implemented. It
       is a wrapper for the PETSc solver type KSPPREONLY, which
       only applies the preconditioner. In conjunction with
       <code>PreconditionLU</code> this provides a
       simple direct solver, which could be used for small to medium
       sized problems on a single processor machine.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2004/07/27)
       </p>
 
 <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>VectorTools::point_difference</code>
       used to use an algorithm to find the cell the given point is in that
       was linear in the total number of active cells. It has been rewritten
       to use
       <code>GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point</code>
       which is only logarithmic in its complexity.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Block matrix iterators could get into all kind of interesting
       (and invalid) states when some of the blocks had empty rows. In this
       common case, we would frequently skip elements when looping over the
       elements of a block matrix. These cases should now be fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: Block matrix iterators used to have a function
       <code>it-&gt;index()</code> that returned something like
       the position within a row. However, this was fragile, and has been
       removed. If you want an ordering of elements within a row, use the
       <code>operator &lt;</code> to compare iterators.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/07/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code
       class="class">PETScWrappers::SolverGMRES::AdditionalData</code>
       class now takes an additional flag indicating the use of left
       or right preconditioning.
       <br> 
       (RH 2004/06/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class can now
       handle float as well as double input matrices and vectors.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">SparseMatrix::vmult</code>-type functions
       <code>vmult</code>, <code>Tvmult</code>, <code>vmult_add</code>, and
       <code>Tvmult_add</code> take two different template arguments for input
       and output vectors, but were only instantiated in case the arguments
       were the same, and could also not be compiled if they weren't. Both
       problems are now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code>
       class used one of the C++ standard containers to store the column
       indices of nonzero entries in a sparse matrix. This proved to be
       inefficient since it requires the allocation of 20 bytes each time an
       element was added, which for large matrices can be millions of
       times. The new storage format uses a more compact data structure, and a
       cache that requires memory allocation only every 8 additions, on
       average. This should significantly reduce the total amount of memory
       required as well as memory fragmentation. It also cuts run-time for
       element addition by more than half.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code
       class="member">CompressedSparsityPattern::max_entries_per_row()</code>
       ignored the first row and thus sometimes returned a value that was too
       low. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>BlockSparseMatrix::clear()</code> did not
       do what it was supposed to do: it emptied the individual blocks and
       removed them, but it still kept the number of blocks
       unchanged. Subsequent accesses to these blocks, or to their information
       yielded segmentation faults.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Block matrices and vectors have been factored into abstract base
       classes and concrete implementation classes. While the previous classes
       still exist in all their functionality, this allowed us to now also
       have block matrices and vectors for PETSc sequential and parallel
       objects.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Vector and block vector classes had a commented out template
       constructor constructing such a vector from a vector object with a
       different template argument, for example constructing a <code
       class="class">Vector&lt;double&gt;</code> from a <code
       class="class">Vector&lt;float&gt;</code>. This constructor has been
       commented out a long time ago due to a compiler bug in which the
       <code>explicit</code> keyword on template constructors was ignored, a
       fact that is dangerous since it may lead the compiler to generate
       temporaries without our ado. This bug is now detected during
       configuration time of the library, and these constructors are available
       whenever the compiler does not contain this bug.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In analogy to the PETSc vector classes, the PETSc matrix classes
       now also have member functions <code>local_range</code>,
       <code>in_local_range</code>, and <code
       class="member">local_size</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Parallel PETSc matrix and vector classes now have member functions
       <code>get_mpi_communicator</code> that returns the MPI
       communicator object these objects operate on.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The PETSc linear solver classes now take a constant, rather
       than a nonconstant reference to the MPI communicator to be used. This
       prevents some unnecessary compiler problems in conjunction with the new
       <code>get_mpi_communicator</code> function.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Parallel and sequential PETSc sparse matrix classes can now be
       initialized (via either constructor or reinit functions) with a
       compressed sparsity pattern object, allowing for more efficient
       preallocation of nonzero entries.

<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>GeometryInfo</code> has two new
       fields <code>unit_normal_direction</code> and
       <code>unit_normal_orientation</code>,
       indicating the direction of the unit normal vector for each
       face of the reference cell.
       <br>
       (GK 2004/12/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: In rare cases of 3d meshes with a certain topology,
       we triggered an assertion in <code
       class="class">TriaAccessor</code>::<code
       class="member">neighbor_child_on_subface</code>. It turns out
       that the code actually computes the correct answer, but the
       assertion had a condition that doesn't always have to be
       satisfied. This bogus assertion is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/11/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>GridGenerator</code>::<code
       class="member">cylinder</code> function in 3d assigned the
       wrong boundary value to the top and bottom part of the cylinder
       if the half length of the cylinder was not equal to 1. This is
       now fixed.
       <br>
       (Ralf Schulz 2004/10/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Now the <code>FE_Q</code> class supports hanging node
       constraints for elements of arbitrary polynomial degree also in
       3D.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2004/10/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="class">StraightBoundary&lt;3&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">get_new_point_on_quad</code>
       did not work on general grids. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/10/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>CylinderBoundary</code>
       represented the hull of a circular tubes along the x-axis. It
       is now extended to allow for circular tubes also along the y-
       and z-axis.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/10/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>ConstraintMatrix</code> class had some
       algorithms that were linear in the number of constraints. Since these
       functions had to be called for each constraint, this resulted in a
       quadratic behavior. To make things worse, these algorithms traversed
       large memory blocks leading to a vast number of cache misses which made
       them really slow. This is now fixed: the algorithm is O(1) and should
       only access single elements in memory, and one 3d testcase is now a
       full 5 per cent faster on about 10 minutes runtime.
       <br>
       (WB 2004/10/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>GridOut</code>::<code
       class="member">write_gnuplot</code> function now supports
       curved boundaries also for <code>dim==3</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2004/09/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The documentation of the <code
       class="member">Triangulation</code> class mentioned that no
       places in the library use or touch the user pointers. That is
       wrong, the <code>SolutionTransfer</code> class
       actually does. This is now properly documented.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/09/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code
       class="member">DerivativeApproximation::approximate_second_derivative</code>
       function produced wrong results ("not a number", or an exception instead of
       "zero") if the field it was given was constant. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/08/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       that works on block matrices and vectors is now templatized over the
       number type, i.e. it also works for float matrices and vectors.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code>FEValuesBase::get_cell</code>
       function returns the current cell, i.e. the latest cell the
       <code>FEValues</code> object was reinited with.
       <br> 
       (RH 2004/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">MatrixTools::local_apply_boundary_values</code> function
       used to set the diagonal entries of boundary nodes to one. This is a
       really bad choice, and the algorithm we use now is much better. There
       are still a few problems when using this function for matrices that
       will be solved as a Schur complement; there is nothing we can do in
       that function in these cases, since we are lacking fundamental pieces
       of information, but the cases where this applies and the strategies to
       work with this problem anyway are now well documented in the
       documentation of the <code>MatrixTools</code> class.
       <br> 
       (WB 2004/06/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>GridGenerator::cylinder_shell</code>
       function generated cells were all inside-out, i.e. had negative
       Jacobians. In usual finite element computations this simply leads to
       all components of the linear system being negated, so it is not
       harmful. It is fixed now anyway.

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>
  <li> <p>
       Changed: The way boundary constraints were handled in the
       step-17 tutorial program was conceptually flawed. We tried to
       eliminate boundary nodes locally on the cell level, and hanging
       node constraints subsequently when transferring into the global
       matrix. However, this doesn't work in general: the elimination
       of hanging node constraints could re-populate rows and columns
       that had already been vacated during boundary node
       elimination. At the end of a long thought process, we came to
       the conclusion that it is impossible to revert the traditional
       order of operations: first eliminate all hanging node
       constraints, then eliminate all boundary nodes. This leads to a
       situation where the <code
       class="member">MatrixTools::local_apply_boundary_values</code>
       function is not very useful any more, except for the special
       case where there are no hanging nodes. The step-17 example
       program has therefore been changed to use the <code
       class="member">MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       function again, though hanging node elimination still happens
       during transfer into the global matrix.
       <br>
       (WB 2005/05/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The class <code
       class="class">MGCoarseGridLACIteration</code> lost two template
       arguments. Since the matrix and preconditioner are now stored
       in form of <code>PointerMatrix</code> objects,
       handling of the class is much simpler, in particular when
       exchanging preconditioners.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/05/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The template argument of <code
       class="class">BlockMatrixArray</code> was changed to
       <tt>number</tt>, equal to the same argument of the used <code
       class="class">BlockVector</code>. Furthermore, its constructor
       requires an additional argument of type <code
       class="class">VectorMemory&lt;Vector&lt;number&gt; &gt;</code>
       providing space for auxiliary vectors. Since the entries are
       now of type <code>PointerMatrixBase</code>, even
       matrices with blocks of different types can be constructed.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/03/21)

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">vertices_adjacent_to_line</code> function has
       been renamed to <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">line_to_cell_vertices</code> to be named
       analogous to the <code
       class="member">face_to_cell_vertices</code>, <code
       class="member">face_to_cell_lines</code> and <code
       class="member">child_to_cell_coordinates</code> functions.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: the file <tt>multigrid/mg_dof_tools.h</tt> was renamed
       to <tt>multigrid/mg_tools.h</tt> in order to match the name of
       the class contained.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/03/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code>DoFTools</code>::<code
       class="member">make_flux_sparsity_pattern</code>, <code
       class="class">MGTools</code>::<code
       class="member">make_flux_sparsity_pattern</code> and similar
       functions in these classes do not receive arguments of type
       <code>FullMatrix&lt;double&gt;</code>
       anymore. Instead, they get a <code
       class="class">Table&lt;2,DoFTools::Coupling&gt;</code>, which
       contains more meaningful enums.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/03/09)

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code>Multigrid</code>::<code
       class="member">Multigrid</code> receives an argument
       determining the type of multigrid cycle instead of the minimum
       and maximum levels. The latter were rarely used anyway and can
       be modified by <code>set_minlevel()</code> and
       <code>set_maxlevel()</code>

<ol>
  <li> <p> New:
       The step-19 tutorial demonstrates handling of parameters from a
       parameter file, as well as some simple techniques for merging output
       from parallel computations. 
       <br>
       (WB 2005/09/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The linking of PETSc libraries into the static
       <tt>libpetsc.g.a</tt> and <tt>libpetsc.a</tt> libraries
       (located in <tt>deal.II/lib</tt>) has now been fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/08/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New:
       The step-18 example program shows how to solve a quasi-static elasticity
       problem with moving meshes, and this all in parallel.
       <br>
       (WB 2005/08/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The files
       <tt>deal.II/include/grid/geometry_info.h</tt> and
       <tt>deal.II/source/grid/geometry_info.cc</tt> have been moved
       to <tt>base/include/base</tt> and <tt>base/source</tt>,
       respectively. A redirection header file has been left in the
       old location for compatibility.
       <br>
       (GK, 2005/07/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Cygwin has problems linking against deal.II DLLs if you
       link against more than one dimension dependent library. The linker
       might issue error messages about multiple defined symbols. This is now
       detected, and the linker is forced to ignore these errors. However, if
       you accidentally defined symbols twice you might have a hard time
       debugging now... In this case remove the <code>-Xlinker 
       --allow-multiple-definition</code> flag from Make.global_options.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2005/07/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Under Cygwin, linking against LAPACK and UMFPACK did
       not work. This is now fixed in the Makefiles. Changes only
       affect Cygwin.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2005/07/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The latest version of UMFPACK, version 4.4, has been imported.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The documentation pages did not contain information
       about the <code>Threads::spawn</code> functions. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/05/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The step-17 example program had a stupid mistake in that it
       initializes the <code>pcout</code> variable with an uninitialized value
       of <code>mpi_communicator</code>. While this seems to have worked for
       some older MPI implementations, this is no longer the case on some
       other systems. It is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/04/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: If there are references to other example programs in any of the
       step-XX programs, then they will now show up as crosslinks in the HTML
       version for simpler navigation of the tutorial.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/04/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The configuration script can now enable special optimizations for
       x86-like processors if called with the <code>--with-cpu=...</code> option.
       This can decrease computation time by up to 30% on certain systems.
       The configuration flag has already existed for PowerPC64 processors, but
       was not documented. Documentation has been added.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2005/03/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: When compiling shared libraries on CygWin systems, warnings
       concerning the <code>-fPIC</code> option were issued by the compiler.
       This is now fixed.       
       Also, configure now issues a message at the end that you should include
       the DLL-path in your <code>.bash_profile</code> file on these systems.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2005/03/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: On certain systems running CygWin, a call to socket functions
       like <code>gethostname()</code> could cause deal.II to hang. The reason
       seems to be that the call disables long double computations which
       revert to just double precision. This then leads to an endless loop in
       computing weights for quadrature points because the convergence
       criterion cannot be reached with simple double precision. This is now
       fixed by disabling the call to <code>gethostname()</code> on these
       systems. A new preprocessor variable, <code>DEAL_II_BROKEN_SOCKETS</code>
       has been added to <code>base/config.h</code> which is defined on
       affected systems.

       (Ralf B. Schulz, WB, 2005/03/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The step-16 example program wasn't listed in the
       navigation bar of the  tutorial section, although it was in the
       table of contents. This is fixed now.

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>PathSearch</code> allows to find
       a file in a sequence of directories and by appending suffixes. The class
       generates the complete file name including directory prefix and suffix
       such that it can be used for subsequently opening the file.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/09/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>ParameterHandler</code> class now does a much better
       job generating output in the <code>print_parameters()</code> function if
       parameters have documentation strings attached to them. See the step-19
       example program output for this.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/09/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a namespace <code>Utilities</code> that contains
       functions that are not particularly specific to finite element codes,
       but are needed in various contexts of application programs anyway.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/08/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: <code>ParameterHandler::get_bool()</code> only accepted
       "true" or "false" as boolean values, now it also considers "yes"
       and "no" as "true" and "false", respectively.

  <li> <p>
       New: A function <code>
       deal_II_exceptions::disable_abort_on_exception</code> now allows
       to disable program abortion when an assertion fails. This is used
       in regression tests.

       Improved: The <code>QProjector</code> now has
       functions <code>project_to_face</code> and <code

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::print_parameters</code>
       function now puts two newlines between regular entries and
       subsection listings for better readability.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/07/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code
       class="member">ParameterHandler::print_parameters</code>
       function now omits printing subsections if they and the contained
       sub-subsections contain no entries.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/07/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Some of the dimension independent functions in the <code
       class="class">DataOutInterface</code> class have been moved into the
       <code>DataOutBase</code> class that does not depend on any
       dimension template parameters. Since the latter is a base class of the
       former, there should be no problems for application programs.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/07/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Several of the functions in class <code
       class="class">ConstantFunction</code> did not check whether the
       component handed to them was valid. In essence, even a scalar
       function could be evaluated for component 42, and the function
       ignored how many components it was declared to have. This is
       now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The functions in class <code
       class="class">ExceptionBase</code> have been renamed to conform
       to our coding conventions that function names be all lower-case
       with words separated by underscores. This is technically an
       incompatible change, since these functions were publicly
       visible, but were usually hidden behind macros and not used
       anywhere explicitly in the library; we hope that this also
       holds for external code.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The GNU C library supports access to the call stack. For
       systems using this library, the <code
       class="class">ExceptionBase</code> class now uses these
       functions to outputs the callstack when the exception is
       created.

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Polynomials::Lagrange</code> class
       allows generation of Lagrange interpolation polynomials for
       arbitrary point sets. In order to get better interpolation for
       higher order polynomials, <code
       class="class">QGaussLobatto</code> has been added to produce
       interpolation point sets clustering at the boundary of a cell
       (weights are not computed yet).

       <br>
       (GK, 2005/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Tensor</code> classes now
       have member functions that compute the Frobenius norm and its
       square. There are also global <code>operator*</code> functions
       that compute the contraction over a pair of indices of tensors.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/04/06)

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOutBase</code> class now

       basically dumps the raw information available in patches.
       <br>
       (WB, 2005/04/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOutReader</code> class allows
       to read data back in from a file into which it has been written
       using intermediate format. From there, it can then be converted
       into any of the supported graphics formats.

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code
       class="member">operator &gt;&gt; (std::istream &amp;in,

  <li> <p>
       New: The new function <code

       indices at the same time.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new function <code
       class="member">TableIndicesBase::sort</code> allows to sort the indices
       in ascending order. This is useful for cases where the order of indices
       is irrelevant (for example in symmetric tables).
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new class <code>SymmetricTensor</code>
       that provides storage and operations for symmetric tensors.

       (WB, 2005/03/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Class <code>Subscriptor</code> receives a
       text argument allowing to identify the violating pointer more
       easily. The additional feature is being incorporated into <code

       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai, 2005/03/07).
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code
       class="class">MultipleParameterLoop::UserClass</code> had only 
       virtual abstract functions but no virtual destructor. This caused
       warnings with some compilers, and is generally bad practice
       anyway. This is now fixed. The same holds with respect to the class
       <code>DataOutInterface</code>.

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code
       class="member">PetscWrappers::MatrixBase::clear_row</code> and <code

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>SparsityPattern</code>::<code
       class="member">block_write</code> neither wrote the number of
       columns of the pattern, nor the flag for optimizing the
       diagonal, and <code>SparsityPattern</code>::<code
       class="member">block_read</code> did not attempt to read this

       (GK, 2005/06/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>SparseDirectUMFPACK</code> now
       has the complete interface of a preconditioner
       class. Therefore, it can be used in iterative solvers and in
       multigrid smoothers.
       <br>

       (WB, 2005/05/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>PETScWrappers::MPI::SparseMatrix</code>
       class had functions that allow to take a pre-existing sparsity pattern
       as the basis for entry allocation. These functions had an option to
       allow pre-setting these entries in the underlying data structures, but
       this option was disabled by default because of unresolved questions
       about its effectiveness. This has now been fixed: The code now properly
       initializes these elements, and makes the resulting matrix much faster
       to use.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/04/04)

       (GK, 2005/03/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>BlockSparseMatrix</code>
       class had no local typedef <code
       class="member">value_type</code> like all other classes, which
       made it a little awkward to use in some places. This has now

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>PETScWrappers</code>::<code
       class="member">MatrixBase</code> class documented that adding
       or setting a value that hasn't been in the sparsity pattern
       before will lead to an exception being thrown. This is of
       course wrong: PETSc allocates matrix entries dynamically, as
       needed. The documentation is now fixed.
       <br> (WB, 2005/03/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The <code>SparseMatrix</code> iterators
       had no <code>operator &gt;</code>, only an <code
       class="member">operator &lt;</code>. The missing operator is
       now implemented. The same holds for the <code
       class="class">FullMatrix</code> class.
       <br> (WB, 2005/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>SparseMatrix</code>
       iterators could not be compared using <code
       class="member">operator &lt;</code>: the compiler complained
       that a private member was accessed. This is now fixed.
       <br> (WB, 2005/03/01)

<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p> Removed: The class <code
  class="class">FiniteElementBase</code> has been removed and all its
  functions are now in <code>FiniteElement</code>.
  <br>
  (GK, 2005/08/25)
  </p>

  <li> <p> New: class <code>DoFTools</code> now has two
  functions <code>compute_row_length_vector</code>, one
  for equations and one for systems. These give a much finer estimate
  for the size of the sparsity pattern required than <code
  class="class">DoFHandler</code>::<code
  class="member">max_couplings_between_dofs</code>. This is
  particularly true for systems with few couplings.
  <br>
  (GK, 2005/08/24)
  </p>

  <li> <p>
       Remove: Due to the reimplementation of the 3d reordering
       algorithm in <code>GridReordering</code> two
       years ago, the <code>CellData::rotate</code>
       function got obsolete. <code
       class="member">CellData::rotate</code> is now removed.
       <br>
       (RH, 2005/08/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: It was possible to compare iterators into different
       <code>DoFHandler</code> objects for equality and
       inequality as long as the underlying triangulation object was
       the same. This doesn't make much sense, however, and even
       sometimes declared to iterators equal if only they had the same
       triangulation, refinement level, and index. Comparing iterators
       into different containers is now completely disallowed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/08/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOutStack::add_data_vector</code>
       function now also allows to give only a single name even if the data is
       vector-valued. It then makes up names for the individual components by
       adding numbers to the name, just like the <code
       class="class">DataOut</code> class already does for a long time.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/07/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOutStack</code> class can now also be
       used to stack two-dimensional time or parameter dependent data into a 3d
       output.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/07/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Function <code>FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">compute_face_embedding_matrices</code> allows for
       automatic computation of embedding matrices on faces under the sole
       assumption that the coarse grid space is embedded into the fine
       grid space. In particular, no interpolation points are
       required.<p>
       
       <p>Using this function, constraint matrices can be computed in
       a general way.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/07/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: All <code>GridIn</code>::<code
       class="member">read_*</code> functions now call <code
       class="class">GridReordering</code>::<code
       class="member">invert_all_cells_of_negative_grid</code>. This
       way, also misoriented grids are represented in the right
       orientation within deal.II.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/07/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code
       class="class">Triangulation&lt;3&gt;</code>::<code
       class="member">create_triangulation</code> now checks that all
       cells have positive volume. If not, an exception is thrown. In
       that case use the <code
       class="class">GridReordering</code>::<code
       class="member">invert_all_cells_of_negative_grid</code>
       function, see below, to fix this.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/07/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code
       class="class">GridReordering</code>::<code
       class="member">invert_all_cells_of_negative_grid</code>
       function implemented in 3d which checks if some/all cells have
       negative volumes. If all cell have negative volume then the
       whole grid is reoriented. An assertion is thrown if only a
       subset of cells have negative volumes, as then the grid might
       be broken.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/07/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code
       class="class">GridTools</code>::<code
       class="member">cell_measure</code> function. However, it is
       mostly for internal use. Use <code>cell->measure()</code>
       instead.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/07/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>cell->measure()</code> used to give the
       absolute value of the cell measure. It now gives the measure
       with the correct sign. This is useful to find wrongly oriented
       cells in 3d with negative volumes.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/07/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The class <code
       class="class">FiniteElementData</code> now stores information
       on the Sobolev space a finite element space conforms with.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/06/29)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p>
       New: Added function <code
       class="class">FiniteElementBase::component_to_system_index</code>
       which was referred to in the documentation, but was missing.
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2005/06/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The function <code
       class="class">DoFTools</code>::<code
       class="member">count_dofs_per_component</code> and its
       counterpart in <code>MGTools</code> got an
       additional argument. This argument allows to count the degrees
       of freedom of nonprimitive vector valued elements only once,
       instead of in every component.  Although this argument defaults
       to the previous behavior, it had to be put into the argument
       list ahead of <tt>target_component</tt> in order to make use of
       default arguments more efficiently. The old order of arguments
       can still be used through a wrapper function.
       <br>
       (GK 2005/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">child_cell_on_face</code>, <code
       class="member">face_to_cell_vertices</code> and <code
       class="member">face_to_cell_lines</code> now have an additional
       <code>face_orientation</code> argument, which has no effect in
       2d and which defaults to <code>true</code> (standard
       orientation) in 3d. Now these functions return the right values
       also for the case of non-standard oriented faces in 3d. This
       avoids several awful pieces of code including questioning
       face_orientation and using child_switch_tables.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/06/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The method <code>FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">lexicographic_to_hierarchic_numbering</code> now
       takes a <code>FiniteElementData</code> instead of
       a <code>FE_Q</code> object. Now this function can
       also be called by the <code>FE_Q</code>
       constructor which avoids code duplication.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The method <code>create_mass_matrix</code>
       in class <code>MatrixCreator</code> can now handle 
       vector valued finite elements. A similar change was applied
       to <code>create_right_hand_side</code> and
       <code>create_boundary_right_hand_side</code>
       in <code>VectorTools</code>. These two changes
       now make the <code>project</code> function work also
       for Raviart-Thomas elements and other vector valued FEs. This
       is very useful, if some initial conditions have to be specified.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, 2005/06/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>DataOut</code> class
       now supports Eulerian Mappings. If a solution is computed
       on a deformed mesh, the output file generated by the DataOut
       now shows the solution also on the deformed mesh. This
       is an option and requires the mapping to be specified as
       additional parameter to <code>build_patches</code>.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, 2005/05/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>MappingQ1Eulerian</code> class can
       now cope with different vector types for the Euler vector.
       This is useful if it should be used with the PETSc wrapper
       classes.  The desired vector type can be specified as template
       parameter.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, 2005/05/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>FE_RaviartThomasNodal</code>
       implements Raviart-Thomas elements using function values in
       Gauss quadrature points on edges and in the interior for its
       node values. The implementation is restricted to Cartesian mesh
       cells right now, but works in 2D and 3D.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/05/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>Mapping::transform_*</code>
       functions accept <code>VectorSlice</code> instead
       of <code>Vector</code>, thus allowing more flexibility.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/05/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values</code>
       function now also works for PETSc sequential and parallel matrices.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/05/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The function <code>GridIn</code>::<code
       class="member">read</code> now searches for files using the
       mechanism provided by the class <code
       class="class">PathSearch</code>. Furthermore, a library of input
       meshes has been started in <code>lib/meshes</code>.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/05/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>DataOut</code> class did not work
       properly if the <code>DataOut::first_cell</code> and
       <code>DataOut::next_cell</code> functions were
       overloaded and cell data was to be output; in that case, data from the
       wrong cells was written out. This is now fixed. In contrast to this,
       nodal data was never affected.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/04/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: By employing the new <code
       class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">line_to_cell_vertices</code>, <code
       class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">face_to_cell_vertices</code> and <code
       class="class">GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">face_to_cell_lines</code> functions the <code
       class="class">Triangulation</code>::<code
       class="member">create_triangulation</code> functions are now
       implemented independent of given conventions for the numbering
       of vertices, lines and faces.
       <br>
       (RH, 2005/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">line_to_cell_vertices</code> function maps line
       vertex numbers to cell vertex numbers.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">face_to_cell_lines</code> function maps face
       line numbers to cell line numbers.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new <code>GeometryInfo</code>::<code
       class="member">face_to_cell_vertices</code> function maps face
       vertex numbers to cell vertex numbers.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/03/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: There was a bug in the <code
       class="class">KellyErrorEstimator</code> class that resulted in
       assertions being thrown when run with multithreading
       enabled. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>Triangulation<2></code>::<code
       class="member">execute_refinement</code> function has been
       re-implemented to accommodate future developments. This change
       results in different ordering and indexing of lines and
       vertices. This leads to a change in the ordering of vertices in
       output files generated by <code>GridOut</code>
       for refined grids.
       <br> 
       (RH, 2005/03/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code>MGDoFHandler</code> had trouble
       when it encountered a triangulation that had unused vertices, something
       that happens when one coarsens an existing triangulation. In
       that case, it would throw unjustified exceptions. This is now
       fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/03/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The class <code>Triangulation::RefinementListener</code> had only
       virtual abstract functions but no virtual destructor. This caused
       warnings with some compilers, and is generally bad practice
       anyway. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB, 2005/02/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Function <code>FETools</code>::<code
       class="member">compute_embedding_matrices</code> allows for
       automatic computation of embedding matrices under the sole
       assumption that the coarse grid space is embedded into the fine
       grid space. In particular, no interpolation points are required.
       <br> 
       (GK, 2005/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: Several wrong assertions in the Raviart-Thomas finite element
       class have been fixed, that were triggered when integrating face terms.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, 2005/01/24; 
        WB, 2005/01/31)

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>


<ol>

  <li> <p>Removed: Several functions in the linear algebra classes that have
   been deprecated for more than a year have been removed.
   <br>
   (GK 2007/08/22)
   </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: Implementing gradients for the class <code>FunctionDerivative</code>, it became evident that its enums for
  difference formulas clashed with those of <code>AutoDerivativeFunction</code>. Therefore, only the latter
  survived.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/08/02)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: When new multigrid transfer classes were introduced,
  the existing class <code>MGTransferSelect</code> was
  moved to the new header file
  <code>multigrid/mg_transfer_component</code>. It also received a new
  base class <code>MGTransferComponent</code>.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/04/26)
  </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Everything that is part of the deal.II library has
       been moved into a namespace <code>dealii</code>. To allow your
       code to compile, you will have to either put a <code>using
       namespace dealii;</code> declaration at the top of each file,
       or qualify each deal.II class and function explicitly with
       <code>dealii::</code> namespace access.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/10/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Indices, such as vertex indices, are usually represented by
       unsigned integers in deal.II. One place where we didn't do this was in
       the <code>CellData</code> structure that can be used to describe cells
       when building a triangulation. This has now been rectified. 
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/09/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Lower dimensional objects have been removed from the
       hierarchical structure of levels in <code>TriaLevel</code>. Faces, i.e. lines in 2D and
       lines and quads in 3D, have no associated level
       anymore. Therefore, the level argument of some iterator
       functions have been removed. The affected functions are <code>Triangulation::begin_raw_face</code>, <code>begin_face</code>, <code>begin_active_face</code> and all <code>last_*_face</code> or <code>end_*_face</code> functions, no matter whether
       raw, used or active. Also effected are the direct iterator
       functions which are related to faces like <code>begin_line</code> in 2D and 3D or <code>begin_quad</code> in 3D. Again, the same applies
       to <code>last_*</code> and <code>end_*</code>.
       <br>
       The respective functions in <code>DoFHandler</code>, <code>hp::DoFHandler</code> and <code>MGDoFHandler</code> have been changed
       accordingly.
       <br>
       Nested loops with an outer loop over all levels and an inner
       loop over all faces on that level have to be changed to a
       single loop over all faces. In most cases, the necessary
       changes should be internal to the library.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht, 2006/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: In order to facilitate the implementation of hp finite
       elements, the ordering of boundary DoFs returned by <code>DoFTools::map_dof_to_boundary_indices</code> has been
       changed. Fortunately, this is a rarely used function so that the effect
       should be limited to only a few programs.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>distribute_local_to_global</code> functions have
       been moved from the classes implementing accessors to arbitrary
       objects in the triangulation to the cell accessors, to
       facilitate the implementation of hp methods. That means
       that you can't call these functions for face or edge iterators
       any more, but only cells. Since this is what is usually
       desired, this should not be too severe a restriction.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/26)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The template argument of the <code>InterGridMap</code> class has been changed. Code
       like e.g. <code>InterGridMap&lt;DoFHandler,2&gt;</code> must be
       replaced by <code>InterGridMap&lt;DoFHandler&lt;2&gt; &gt;</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>DoFObjectAccessor</code> and derived classes
       used to take only the space dimension and the dimension of the
       object they represented as template arguments. Now the later
       argument is replaced by the type of DoFHandler they correspond
       to. This may be <code>::DoFHandler</code> or
       <code>hp::DoFHandler</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/10, WB 2005/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Removed: Support for gcc2.95 in particular, and all compilers that do
       not support the <code>std::ostringstream</code> class in general,
       has been removed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/02/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Several classes related to the storage of data in the
       Triangulation and DoFHandler classes have been moved into internal
       namespaces, and some have also been removed. Since these were not for
       use anywhere outside the library, it is unlikely that this poses
       problems to application programs. On the other hand, it moves common
       names like <code>Line</code> and <code>Quad</code> out of the global
       namespace.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, if <code>mg_dof_handler</code> was a
       multilevel DoF handler object, calling
       <code>DoFRenumbering::component_wise(mg_dof_handler)</code>)
       didn't quite do what was probably intended: it did an implicit
       cast of <code>mg_dof_handler</code> to its base class,
       <code>DoFHandler</code> and then renumbered the <em>global</em>
       degrees of freedom, but didn't touch the multilevel part. This
       has now been fixed: there is another function that takes a
       <code>MGDoFHandler</code> object and that renumbers the global
       part as well as all levels of the multigrid part. The change is
       incompatible since the previous call now leads to a different
       action; if you really want the old behavior back, cast the
       argument to the base class before the call, like so:
       <code>DoFRenumbering::component_wise(static_cast&lt;DoFHandler&lt;dim&gt;&&gt;(mg_dof_handler))</code>)
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/12/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The internal numbering of faces, lines and vertices
       has been reimplemented. Now the numbering scheme uses a
       lexicographic ordering (with x running fastest) wherever
       possible. For more information on the new numbering scheme, see
       the <a
       href="http://ganymed.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/pipermail/dealii/2005/000827.html">announcement</a>
       on the mailing list.  <br> The ordering of vertices in <code>CellData</code> given to the <code>Triangulation::create_triangulation</code>
       function has been changed accordingly. For backward
       compatibility there is now a new <code>Triangulation::create_triangulation_compatibility</code>
       function which takes <code>CellData</code> in the
       old vertex ordering. However, as this function might not be
       supported forever users are advised to change their code to the
       new numbering scheme and to use the <code>Triangulation::create_triangulation</code>
       function.

  <li> <p>Improved: Tests for libraries in configure can handle --without now.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/08/22)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Updated: The version of UMFPACK bundled with deal.II has been updated
       to release 5.1.0.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/08/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-27 tutorial program has been added. It solves a Laplace
          equation with hp finite elements 
	  and shows how to set finite element degrees, assemble matrices on
	  cells with varying polynomial degrees, and how to compute a simple
	  criterion for estimating the local Sobolev smoothness of a function.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/08/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The table of contents of tutorial programs now also shows
       subsections of introduction and results.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/08/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: Up to now, in 3D only 'orientable' meshes could be used in
       deal.II, i.e. all lines are in standard orientation and the faces can be
       either in standard orientation or with a reversed normal. In order to
       enable the treatment of all purely hexahedral meshes, this interface
       (only the boolean flag <tt>face_orientation</tt> so far) has
       been extended by new flags <tt>face_flip</tt> and <tt>face_rotation</tt>,
       denoting a face which is rotated against the 'standard face' by 180 and 90
       degrees, respectively. Furthermore, there is a new flag
       <tt>line_orientation</tt> with obvious meaning. 
		 <br> These flags have to be respected during creation and refinement of a
		 triangulation, when projecting quadrature points to faces or when the dof
		 indices on a cell are extracted. Furthermore, asking for vertices and
		 lines of cells is in some cases a bit more complicated. The same applies,
       for example, 
		 to the extraction of the information, which child of a neighbor is behind
		 a given subface. However, this information is supplied by various
		 functions in <code>GeometryInfo</code>. As a rule-of-thumb:
		 if you want to use non-standard meshes, all occurrences of
		 <tt>face_orientation</tt> have to be supplemented by <tt>face_flip</tt>
		 and <tt>face_rotation</tt>.
       <br> In order to reduce the impact of possible bugs, the grid is still given to
       <code>GridReordering</code>, which now returns the original
       connectivity if the reordering was not possible.
       <br> A more detailed document concerning these topics will be available
       in the future.
		 <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2007/02/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: a program <tt>reconfigure</tt> has been added to the
       deal.II main directory, which reruns <tt>configure</tt> with
       the sam command line arguments as last time.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/10/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-25 tutorial program, demonstrating the
       solution of the nonlinear sine-Gordon equation (a variant of
       the time dependent wave equation) has been added.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/11/05)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-21 tutorial program is ready. It considers time
       dependent two-phase flow through a porous medium.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/10/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The step-23/step-24 tutorial programs have been added,
       discussing how to solve the wave equation.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/10/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: when building the library in parallel, using <code>make
        -jN</code> (most often with rather large values of <code>N</code>, for
	example 8), it could sometimes happen that the same file is compiled
	twice at exactly the same time. This leads to invalid object files and
	libraries that would contain illegal instructions. This is now fixed.
	<br>
	(WB 2006/08/09)
	</p> 

  <li> <p> Changed: The default number of subdivisions in the <code>build_patches</code> functions of the DataOut classes is
       now part of the parameters read by <code>parse_parameters</code>. This default value is used
       whenever patches with zero subdivisions are being built.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/06/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: a configuration parameter <tt>--with-boost</tt> has been
	introduced, allowing the selection of a previously installed boost
	library instead of the contibuted.
	<br>
	(GK 2006/03/23)
	</p> 

  <li> <p>New: The step-20 tutorial program was added. It shows how to use
       Raviart-Thomas elements to solve a mixed formulation of the Laplace
       equation. It also demonstrates the use of block matrices and vectors,
       and how they can be used to define more complex solvers and
       preconditioners working on the Schur complement.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Updated: The <code>deal.II/contrib/boost</code> library has
       been updated to boost version 1.33.1.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Documentation has been greatly enhanced, both in the
       API documentation as well as in the tutorial programs. In
       particular, the step-1 through step-8 tutorial programs have
       been overhauled and in many cases the documentation has been
       rewritten in large parts. The presentation of tutorial programs
       and reference manual should also be nicer and better readable
       in many cases.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Previously, the UMFPACK code was linked into its own
       library, <code>liblac_umfpack.*</code>. Instead, it is now
       directly linked into the <code>liblac.*</code> libraries. This
       makes further linking simpler than before and also simplified
       the link process.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/01/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The order of quadrature points is now x fastest, z slowest, as
       well as the vertices of cells. Also, the nodes and subcells of patches
       in DataOutBase follow the same ordering. Output code could be simplified
       a lot, saving 900 lines of code.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: Documentation of tutorial program is now run through
       Doxygen. This allows cross-referencing the tutorial programs to
       the API manual (and the other way round) and leads to a
       generally much nicer output. In particular, formulas embedded
       in the documentation of the programs are now properly displayed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The link to the manual now points directly to
       Doxygen's module list, and almost all classes are now grouped
       into modules that capture related functionality.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: If you do have a PETSc installation
       and have set the <code>PETSC_DIR</code> and
       <code>PETSC_ARCH</code> environment variables but do not wish
       deal.II to be configured for PETSc use, you
       should specify <code>--with-petsc=no</code> as a flag during
       configuration. 
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/01/16)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: In all directories, including those for tutorial
       programs, we generate a file called <code>Makefile.dep</code>
       that lists the dependencies of object files on source files,
       and that the <code>make</code> uses to determine which files to
       recompile. If the generation of this file failed (for example
       if <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> hadn't been set correctly), a
       number of very strange things would happen, among others the
       attempt to link an empty object file. This was almost
       impossible to figure out if you didn't know what was going
       on. This mechanism has now been robustified and should yield
       better error messages.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/11/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The dynamic libraries, which is the name of shared libs
       under Apples OSX, are now supported on these platforms and
       enabled by default. They should safe a lot of harddisk space.
       <br> 
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold 2005/10/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <tt>Tecplot</tt> library (<tt>tecio.a</tt>) was
       detected but not added to <tt>LIBS</tt>. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: <tt>configure</tt> will automatically detect a
       <tt>NetCDF</tt> installation, when its path is given by the
       <tt>NETCDF_DIR</tt> environment variable. The path of the
       <tt>NetCDF</tt> installation directory can also be specified
       through the <tt>--with-netcdf=/path/to/netcdf</tt> configure
       option.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The PETSc libraries have been relinked each time
       <tt>make</tt> was called. Now, the PETSc libraries will only be
       relinked if necessary.

  <li> <p> New: There is a new class:
       <code>Functions::FEFieldFunction</code> which is a Function
       interface to a finite element solution. 
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2007/08/29)

  
  <li> <p> Improved: <code>FunctionDerivative</code> is now
  derived from <code>AutoDerivativeFunction</code> and implements
  gradients as well, giving you automatic second derivatives of a function.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/08/02)
  </p>

  <li> <p> New: The function <code>Utilities::fixed_power&lt;n&gt;(q)</code>
       calculates <code>q</code> to the power of <code>n</code> where
       <code>n</code> is a constant known at compile time. It allows to
       calculate powers efficiently at compile time, most often things like a
       number to the power <code>dim</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2007/06/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The deal.II intermediate format has been
       changed. Since files in this format are only meant to be
       processed by exactly the same version of deal.II, this should
       be of no concern to users. However, this restriction was
       previously undocumented, even if implied. The documentation for
       this has now been updated.
       <br> 
       (WB 2007/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code>Functions::Monomial</code> class implements
       monomials as a function object.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/12/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: If no substring is found with a width smaller than the given
       threshold, the <code>Utilities::break_text_into_lines</code> function now
       returns the smallest possible substring (larger than the threshold).
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/12/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: We used to set preprocessor variables
       <code>PACKAGE_NAME</code>, <code>PACKAGE_TARNAME</code>,
       <code>PACKAGE_VERSION</code>, <code>PACKAGE_STRING</code>,
       <code>PACKAGE_BUGREPORT</code> in the file
       <code>&lt;base/config.h&gt;</code>. These variables were automatically
       set by the autoconf package, with which we generate the
       <code>./configure</code> script. However, these variables would conflict
       if someone were to use a different package that also uses autoconf,
       since that package would have the same variables, just set to different
       values. The preprocessor warns about these cases.
       <br>
       We now avoid this conflict by not using these names any more. Instead,
       we use the preprocessor names as above, prefixed with
       <code>DEAL_II_</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/11/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Extended: The <code>QGaussLobatto</code> quadrature
       rule computes Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto nodes and quadrature weights.
       <br>
       (Florian Prill 2006/11/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Extended: The <code>contract</code> function family contracts two
       tensors. There is now a new version of this function, that contracts a
       tensor of rank three with a second one of rank two over given indices
       <tt>index1</tt> and <tt>index2</tt> of the first and second tensor,
       respectively, resulting in a tensor of rank three. 
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/09/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The
       <code>DataOutBase::write_deal_II_intermediate</code> function
       did not check whether it can actually write to the stream
       given. It would therefore silently do nothing if the file could
       not be written to. This is now fixed: an exception is generated
       in that case, as for all the other output functions in that class.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: Stack backtraces in multithreaded mode were often
       very long and almost unreadable because the functions in
       namespace <code>Threads</code> that are used to set up new
       threads have long and awkward signatures. The output is now
       filtered to make these backtraces easier to read.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The second argument to <code>Utilities::int_to_string</code>
       can now be omitted, leading to a string that isn't zero padded at all.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Changed: When there is still a <code>SmartPointer</code> object
       pointing to another object at the time it is destroyed, this would cause
       the program to be aborted. However, there are cases where this is not
       desirable, for example here:
       <pre>
       <code>
          void f() 
          {
	    Triangulation tria;
	    DoFHandler *dh = new DoFHandler(tria);
	    ...some function that throws an exception
          }
       </code>
       </pre>
       When the exception is thrown but not caught, the two local objects are
       destroyed in reverse order of their construction, i.e. first the pointer
       then the triangulation. However, only the pointer, not the
       <code>DoFHandler</code> pointed to is destroyed, triggering the abort in
       the triangulation since there is still the <code>DoFHandler</code>
       object pointing to it at the time of destruction of the
       triangulation. In such cases, one would not want to see the program
       aborted, since then one would never learn about the actual exception
       being thrown.
       <br>
       The behavior of the <code>Subscriptor</code> class as therefore been
       changed to not abort the program any more if an exception is being
       handled at the moment. Rather, only an error message is shown on
       <code>std::cerr</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/08/01)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: The <code>TableHandler::write_tex</code>
       accidentally took a parameter of type
       <code>std::ofstream</code> instead of <code>std::ostream</code>
       and could therefore only write to files, not to other kinds of
       streams. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/07/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: <code>GeometryInfo</code> offers several new
       functions, <code>is_inside_unit_cell</code> with an epsilon parameter to
       specify allowable offsets from the actual unit cell,
       <code>distance_to_unit_cell</code> returning the infinity norm of the
       distance of a given point to the unit cell, and
       <code>project_to_unit_cell</code> returning the projection of a point
       onto the unit cell. Also, a new member <code>vertex_to_face</code> allow
       to determine to which faces of a cell a vertex belongs. 
       <br>
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2006/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>DataOutBase</code>::<code>OutputFormat</code> has a new value <tt>none</tt>,
       writing no output at all. This way, the writing of output files can be
       controlled more easily from parameter files.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>VectorSlice</code> has new functions
       <code>begin()</code> and <code>end()</code>,
       returning the corresponding vector iterators.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The various tensor classes can now effectively be reset to zero
       by simply writing <code>t=0;</code> as has long been allowed for
       matrices and vectors.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p> New: The new <code>deal_II_numbers::is_finite</code> function can
       be used to check whether a floating point number is finite,
       i.e. neither plus or minus infinite nor NaN (not a number);
       it is in the new include file <tt>base/numbers.h</tt>, which will
       contain non-configured inline functions of this type.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/15) (GK 2006/03/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: If the C++ runtime environment allows it, we now
       demangle stacktraces generated whenever an exception is thrown.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The function <code>Subscriptor</code>::<code>list_subscribers</code> logs all current subscribers of an
       object to <tt>deallog</tt>.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: Writing a denormal "NaN" through <code>LogStream</code> objects such as 
       <code>deallog</code> erroneously printed zero, rather
       than "nan". This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Luca Heltai, WB 2006/03/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: The <code>TableBase</code> base class of all
       the <code>Table</code> classes had an
       <code>>operator()</code> that takes a <code>TableIndices</code> object
       that represents the entire set of indices at once. However, due to C++
       name lookup rules, this operator wasn't accessible through the
       <code>Table</code> class without explicitly specifying the base class
       name. This is now fixed by also providing a similar
       <code>>operator()</code> in the derived classes.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>QGauss</code> constructor
       hangs on x86 linux systems when deal.II is run from inside
       MATLAB. The reason is that while the processor offers long
       double accuracy, MATLAB switches off support for that inside
       the CPU. It therefore leaves codes that expect the additional
       accuracy high and dry. Annoyingly, these codes of course run
       just fine outside of MATLAB's environment. This behavior leads
       to an infinite loop inside the QGauss constructor, where we
       want to use the additional accuracy to compute quadrature
       points to high precision. To avoid the infinite loop, we now
       check during runtime whether the extra precision is available,
       not only at compile time.

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>ParameterHandler::get_integer</code>
       had an erroneous check that the value given for a parameter really
       represented an integer. This check always succeeded, even in face of an
       error, and a zero value was returned every time the value in the
       parameter file happened to be not an integer.

       (WB 2006/02/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: The <code>ComponentSelect</code> class can
       now also handle the case that one wants to select multiple vector
       components at once, not only a single one.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/02/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: A new function <code>TableBase</code>::<code>fill</code>, filling the whole table with the same
       element has been introduced.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/18)

  <li> <p>Improved: <code>DataOutBase</code> now writes binary
       files for OpenDX.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions
       <code>ParameterHandler::set</code> that allow to set the value of a
       parameter to something different later on.
       <br>
       (Marc Secanell, WB 2006/1/2)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are new functions
       <code>Utilities::match_at_string_start</code> and 
       <code>Utilities::get_integer_at_position</code>.
       <br>
       (WB 2005/12/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The computation of <code>HMIN</code> and
       <code>HMAX</code> in <code>DataOutBase::write_povray</code> has been
       wrong. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/11/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code>DataOutBase&lt;2,3&gt;::write_tecplot_binary</code>
       did not write the <code>z</code> coordinates. This is now
       fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2005/09/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <tt>tecplot_binary</tt> <code>OutputFormat</code> has been added to <code>DataOutBase::get_output_format_names</code>. Now
       an exception will be raised if <code>write_tecplot_binary</code> is invoked without
       specifying the filename through the <code>DataOutBase::TecplotFlags</code> interface.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now new <code>get_n_mpi_processes</code> and <code>get_this_mpi_process</code> functions in the
       <code>Utilities::System</code> namespace. In case
       of a code not running in parallel, they simply return 1 and 0,

  <li> <p>Changed: The <code>CompressedBlockSparsityPattern</code> has been renamed to
       <code>BlockCompressedSparsityPattern</code> to be
       consistent, since the "block" part builds on the "compressed sparsity
       pattern", not the other way around. The old name remains as a typedef,
       but its use is deprecated.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/06/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The <code>CompressedSetSparsityPattern</code>
       class is an alternative to the <code>CompressedSparsityPattern</code> class that appears to be
       better suited for problems that have many entries per row. There is also
       a block version, <code>BlockCompressedSetSparsityPattern</code>. The two new
       classes can used in all places where a regular compressed sparsity
       pattern can also be used.
       <br>
       (Oliver Kayser-Herold, WB 2007/06/03)

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>SolverBicgstab</code> class
       did not handle hitting on the solution early very
       gracefully (it threw an exception). This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Roger Young 2007/03/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class allows
       to run the sparse direct solver as a separate program (the
       <code>detached_ma27</code> program) rather than as part of the current
       program in order to be able to run several instances of it in parallel
       during multithreaded computations. However, the destructor of the <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> class had a bug that when using
       this detached mode led to a segmentation fault. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/02/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: A simple <code>print_formatted</code> 
       function has been added to <code>SparseMatrixEZ</code>.
       <br>
       (Moritz Allmaras 2007/02/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>SparseDirectMA27</code> 
       class works for symmetric matrices and had a check to make sure the
       matrix is indeed symmetric. However, the check compared entries for
       equality, something one should not do for floating point numbers. It now
       checks that symmetric entries are equal up to a small relative number.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/12/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Fixed: The <code>FullMatrix::invert</code> 
       function would return wrong results if one tried to invert a
       matrix of dimension smaller than 5 in situ. This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Florian Prill 2006/12/18)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: The <code>SparsityPattern</code> class would produce
       segmentation faults if one tried to allocate a matrix with more
       than about 4.2 billion elements (i.e. the number that one can
       store in a 32-bit unsigned integer). This is now fixed: if you
       have enough memory, this is now possible on 64-bit
       systems. (The number of rows is still limited by the 32-bit
       limit, but this is probably going to be enough for some time to
       come.) This fix also required changing the return type of the
       <code>SparsityPattern::get_rowstart_indices</code> function
       from <code>const unsigned int *</code> to <code>const
       std::size_t *</code>; since this function should not be used
       outside of the library anyway, this is probably not a change
       that affects user code.

       (WB 2006/12/14)

  <li> <p>New: The class <code>PointerMatrixVector</code> implements the functions
       <code>vmult</code> and <code>Tvmult</code> for a <i>1xn</i>-matrix represented by
       a single vector.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/09/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: The class <code>SolverCG</code> can
       now estimate the condition number of the linear system using <code>TridiagonalMatrix</code> and LAPACK.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/09/06)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>New: the class <code>TridiagonalMatrix</code>
       has been introduced together with its basic methods, including an
       eigenvalue solver for the symmetric case (LAPACK).
       <br>
       (GK 2006/09/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: PETSc 2.3.1 (<i>build 16</i>) is now supported by the
       linear preconditioner classes. The new PETSc functions 
       <code>PCFactorSetXXX</code> are used.<br>       
       (Florian Prill, 2006/08/04)
       </p>

  <li> <p>New: The class <code>TransposeMatrix</code>
       modeled after <code>PointerMatrix</code> swaps the
       <code>vmult</code> functions such that its effect is
       the transpose of the matrix it points to.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/07/07)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>New: There is now a function <code>FullMatrix::trace</code> that does what its name suggests
       it does.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/06/16)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p>Improved: <code>PointerMatrixAux</code> now has a
       default constructor and a function for setting the <code>VectorMemory</code> object.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/06/14)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p>Fixed: <code>FullMatrix::print</code> would yield a link error
       when used with <code>std::ofstream</code> since an explicit
       instantiation was missing. The function has now been moved to
       the header file and made inline so that it is always visible,
       whatever the type of the output stream is.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/06/07)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> Improved: The <code>SparseDirectUMFPACK</code> solver can now also be
       used with sparse matrices with elements of type float, as well
       as with block matrices with types float and double.

  <li> <p> New: The function <code>BlockSparsityPattern::row_length</code> adds up
       the row lengths of the individual blocks of a block matrix for
       a given row.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/25)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> New: There is a new class <code>IdentityMatrix</code> that represents an
       efficient version of the matrix with ones on the diagonal and
       zeros everywhere else. The main usefulness of this matrix lies
       in the fact that most other important matrix classes have
       assignment operators and copy constructors that allow to
       conveniently fill a (sparse, full) matrix with the identity
       matrix.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/24)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> New: There are now assignment operators from <code>BlockVector</code> to <code>Vector</code> and back.
       <br>
       (WB 2006/03/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>BlockSparsityPattern</code> can be
       initialized directly using the vector generated by
       <code>DoFTools</code>::<code>compute_row_length_vector</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: All matrix (and some vector) classes now check whether
       entries written into them represent finite floating point
       values. This should catch some bugs earlier where one writes
       infinite or NaN values into a matrix only to realize later that
       the linear solver fails.

       (Stephan Kramer, WB 2006/03/15)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Changed: There are new <code>FullMatrix</code>::<code>equ</code> functions which assign <tt>this</tt>
       matrix to the linear combination of one, two or three
       matrices. Also there is now a new <code>Vector</code>::<code>equ</code>
       function for three vectors.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/21)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>SolverMinRes</code> class did not work
       with the <code>BlockVector</code> class.
       This is now fixed.
       <br>
       (Luca Heltai 2006/02/19)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Changed: There are now new <code>FullMatrix</code>::<code>add</code> functions which add two and three
       scaled matrices.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/16)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The matrix classes <code>FullMatrix</code>, <code>SparseMatrix</code>, <code>SparseMatrixEZ</code> and <code>BlockMatrixBase</code> now have an <code>add</code> function analogous to the <code>add</code> of vector classes. The old <code>add_scaled</code> functions are now deprecated.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/16)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>       
       Improved: <code>BlockMatrixArray</code>::<code>enter_aux</code> allows using matrices without
       adding vector multiplication by using <code>PointerMatrixAux</code>.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/02/02)
       </p>  

  <li> <p>
       New: The class <code>PointerMatrixAux</code> was
       introduced for use with matrix classes lacking the adding
       vector multiplication functions. It implements these by using
       its own auxiliary vector.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/02/02)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>FilteredMatrix</code> class
       was able to filter only the <code>SparseMatrix</code>
       matrix class.
       A new (faster) version is now in its place with the same interface 
       that is able to perform such a filter on anything that provides 
       the usual matrix vector operations.
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/01/09)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: All solver classes took an argument of type <code>VectorMemory</code> which they use to allocate
       memory for temporary vectors. A clever implementation of this
       class might allow reusing temporary vectors, and thus reduce
       the overhead of repeatedly allocating and freeing
       memory. However, almost all instances of using these classes
       used the <code>PrimitiveVectorMemory</code>
       class. The solver class have now been changed so that if one
       omits the respective argument, they fall back to using such a
       memory object. Also, all example programs that did not
       specifically use a different memory allocation class, have been
       changed to not specify anything at all, and thus fall back to
       the default.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/11/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>SparseMatrix</code> iterators had a
       problem when one wrote code like <code>iterator->value()=0</code>
       (i.e. with a zero integer, rather than a floating point number on the
       right), in that that opened up a second conversion sequence and the
       compiler complained about an ambiguity. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2005/10/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Now the class <code>SparseILU</code> supports
       also the <code>Tvmult</code> method. This feature
       allows the straightforward use of <code>SparseILU</code>
       as a multigrid smoother within the framework.

       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2007/08/29)
  
   <li> <p>Fixed: the function
       <code>DataOut::build_patches</code> 
       had a quadratic algorithm when generatic cell-data (as opposed
       to DoF data). This algorithm became a bottleneck when
       generating output on meshes with large number of cells. This is
       now fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/08/28)

   <li> <p>New: the function

       extracts for each cell the active finite element index used on it.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/08/07)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Extended: the function
       <code>Triangulation::copy_triangulation</code> 
       copies all members of a triangulation except for the list of
       <code>RefinementListener</code>s. In most cases this is exactly the
       intended behavior. However, if a RefinementListener should be copied to
       the new triangulation, e.g. if a Persistent Triangulation is created from
       an ordinary one, it can do so now through implementing the new
       function <code>RefinementListener::copy_notification</code>.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2007/06/05)
       </p>

   <li> <p>New: the function
       <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern</code> 
       now takes an optional constraint matrix argument that can be used to
       avoid the subsequent call to condense the sparsity pattern. In effect,
       the sparsity pattern is generated condensed right away. For problems in
       3d and with many constraints, this is many times faster than separate
       creation and condensation.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/06/03)
       </p>

   <li> <p>New: the new function
       <code>ConstraintMatrix::add_entries_local_to_global</code> 
       can be used to add entries to a matrix where entries that will appear if
       the current entry corresponds to a constrained degree of freedom are
       also added.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/06/03)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Fixed: the function
       <code>GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex</code> 
       was not detecting properly the coarse cells adjacent to
       refined cells.
       <br>

       </p>

       <code>DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component</code> and
       <code>DoFTools::count_dofs_per_block</code> where changing the
       size of the destination vector. Consistently with (most of) the 
       rest of the library, now the vectors are expected to be the 
       right size before calling these functions. 
       <br>
       (Luca Heltai 2007/05/15)

  vectors for single blocks of a system and for several blocks.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/04/26)
  </p>

   <li> <p>New: There is a new variant of
       <code>DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern</code> that can be used to
       construct sparsity patterns corresponding to problems where one would
       like to test shape functions defined on one mesh with shape functions
       defined on a different mesh (or on the same mesh but using a different
       DoFHandler that may use a different finite element, for example).

       (Yaqi Wang 2007/03/09)
       </p>

   <li> <p>New: The
       <code>ConstraintMatrix::write_dot</code> function can be used
       to produce a graphical representation of the graph of
       constraints stored in the constraint matrix. The output can be
       sent through the "dot" program to produce a number of graphical
       formats, such as postscript, png, or xfig.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/03/08)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Fixed: The
       <code>GridGenerator::cylinder</code> function in 3d properly
       set the boundary indicators of the end faces of the generated
       cylinder to a different value than the outer faces, but it
       forgot to also adjust the boundary indicators of the edges
       purely in the interior to the ends of the cylinder. This is now
       fixed.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/03/08)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Improved: The
       <code>CylinderBoundary</code> class can now describe the
       boundaries of arbitrarily oriented cylinders, not only does
       oriented parallel to the axes and going through the origin.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/03/08)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Improved: The
       <code>GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number</code> and
       <code>GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction</code> functions
       have gained an additional last argument that can be used to specify a
       maximal number of cells that we would like to use in a
       triangulation. Its default value is set to indicate that no limit is
       desired, as is the previous behavior.
       <br>
       (WB 2007/02/20)
       </p>

   <li> <p>New: Added function <code>GridGenerator</code>::<code >hyper_cube_with_cylindrical_hole</code> that produces 
	a square with a circular hole in the middle in 2d, and extrudes it
	along the z-direction between 0 and L. 
        <br>
        (Luca Heltai 2007/02/15)
        </p>

   <li> <p>Workaround: The class <code>GridOut</code>::<code >write_msh</code> produces a mesh which can be visualized
	in the Gmsh reader. A bug in Gmsh prevented the boundary indicator to
	be properly visualized. The boundary indicator was added to the
	material flag of the faces (which is ignored when reading back the
	mesh) in order for the Gmsh reader to be able to display the boundary
	indicator in a proper way.

   <li> <p>Fixed: The function <code>DoFTools</code>::<code >distribute_cell_to_dof_vector</code> produced
       wrong results if the vector into which the result is to be
       stored contained nonzero values. This is now fixed.

       (Rohallah Tavakoli, WB 2007/02/13)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Fixed: A local variable in
       <code>TriaAccessor&lt;3,3&gt;::measure</code> was
       erroneously marked as static could lead to
       wrong results and crashes in multithreaded mode. This is now fixed.

       (WB 2007/02/09)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Fixed: <code>MatrixCreator</code>::<code >create_mass_matrix</code> and <code>
       create_laplace_matrix</code> computed wrong values for the right 
       hand sides. This has been fixed. 
       <br>
       (Moritz Allmaras 2007/02/08)
       </p>

   <li> <p>Extended: <code>DataOutBase::Patch</code> has been extended by
       a new boolean flag <tt>points_are_available</tt>, which
       defaults to <tt>false</tt>. It is set to <tt>true</tt> if the
       coordinates of the points defining the subdivision of a patch
       are appended to the <tt>data</tt> table contained in a
       <code>Patch</code>. This way, <code>DataOut</code>::<code>build_patches()</code> can use a <code>Mapping</code> to represent curved boundaries,
       especially for higher order elements. This change corresponds
       to an extension of the intermediate format for graphics.
       <br>
       Fixed: Using the given <code>Mapping</code> to
       obtain function values in <code>DataOut</code>::<code>build_patches()</code> also fixes a bug for
       <code>FE_RaviartThomas</code> and <code>FE_ABF</code>elements, which need to evaluate the
       function values on the real (mapped) cell.

       (Tobias Leicht 2007/01/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: On faces with wrong <code>face_orientation</code> the dofs
       have to reordered in order to be combined with the correct shape
       functions. This is only relevant for continuous elements in 3D. At least for
       <code>FE_Q</code> and systems of <code>FE_Q</code> this works now, for other finite elements the
       reordering vector still has to be implemented.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht, 2007/01/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>Triangulation</code>::<code>execute_coarsening_and_refinement</code> function has to
       discard coarsening flags in 2d and 3d if a neighbor of a flagged cell is
       refined or will be refined, in order to avoid that we end up with
       neighboring cells that differ in refinement by two levels. The function
       was overly conservative, however, in that it didn't allow a cell to be
       coarsened if its neighbor is once refined but is also marked for
       coarsening. This is now fixed and will lead to a few more cells being
       coarsened.

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>Triangulation</code>::<code>
       MeshSmoothing</code> flag <code>patch_level_1</code> wrongly produced cells
       on level 0 during <code>coarsening_and_refinement</code>, which is now fixed.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: There is now a new <code>Triangulation</code>
       ::<code>MeshSmoothing</code> flag <code>coarsest_level_1</code>
       which ensures that after <code>coarsening_and_refinement</code> there are no
       cells on level 0, i.e. the coarsest level is 1, if the triangulation had
       <code>coarsest_level_1</code> already before.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/12/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>GridIn</code> class can now
       read in tecplot files in ASCII format (block and point format,
       ordered and unstructured grids, format specifiers acccording to
       Tecplot 10 and younger versions). At the moment the
       implementation is restricted to 2d grids but can easily be
       extended to 3d as well.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/12/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: So far, the <code>GridReordering</code>::<code>invert_all_cells_of_negative_grid</code>
       function did nothing in 2d. Now, it inverts cells from
       clockwise to counterclockwise sense (in the old numbering
       scheme).
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/12/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a function <code>GridTools</code>::<code>delete_duplicated_vertices</code> that deletes
       duplicate vertices which can occur if structured grids are read
       into deal.II, leading to unwanted interior
       boundaries. In order to reduce the effort of the quadratic
       algorithm, a list of vertices to be considered can be supplied
       if available.
       <br>
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/12/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now two new functions <code>GridGenerator</code>::<code>subdivided_hyper_rectangle</code> that produces
       a non-uniformly subdivided rectangle, ideally suited for graded
       meshes. One of these functions is able to create meshes with holes. 
       <br>
       (Yaqi Wang 2006/11/15, 2006/12/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Fixed: Corrected <code>clone</code> method 
       of <code>FE_DGQ</code> class for non-equidistant 
       support points.
       <br>
       (Florian Prill 2006/10/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: The lookup mechanism in <code>FETools</code>::<code>get_fe_from_name</code> has been changed, so
       additional custom finite elements can be added using <code>FETools</code>::<code>add_fe_name</code>. In the course of this
       change, the implementation of the lookup mechanism has been
       simplified.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/10/24)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new functions <code>GridTools</code>::<code>create_union_triangulation</code>
       that generates a triangulation that contains the respectively
       finest cells of two input triangulations.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/10/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>ConstraintMatrix</code> class did not
       allow that one degree of freedom was constrained against another DoF
       that was itself constrained. However, this is necessary for the
       implementation of hp methods and is now allowed. Arbitrarily long chains
       of constraints are resolved at the time the
       <code>ConstraintMatrix::close()</code> function is called. The only
       thing that is not allowed are cycles in such constraints.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/09/19)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are new functions <code>GridTools::minimal_cell_diameter</code> and <code>GridTools::maximal_cell_diameter</code>, with obvious
       functionality. 
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/09/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The functions <code>FETools::compute_embedding_matrices</code>,
       <code>FETools::compute_face_embedding_matrices</code>, and
       <code>FETools::compute_projection_matrices</code>
       (mostly used in internal computations in setting up finite
       element objects) previously took pointers to the first element
       of an array of matrices as arguments. This isn't type-safe, and
       in particular did not allow to check for the number of matrices
       in the array. The functions now take a reference to an array of
       the correct length.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/08/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: The <code>VectorTools::project</code> functions
       are now also implemented for 1d.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/08/08)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Extended: <code >DerivativeApproximation</code> now offers access to the
       full tensor of derivatives of orders one, two and three. This
       information can be requested for a single cell by means of the <code>DerivativeApproximation</code><code>::approximate_derivative_tensor</code> function. If the
       norm of this tensor is required later on, the new <code >DerivativeApproximation</code><code>::derivative_norm</code> function can be used. Note, that
       for second order derivatives, this returns the largest eigenvalue
       instead of the Frobenius norm, which is returned by the <code >Tensor&lt;rank_,dim&gt;</code><code>::norm</code> function.
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/08/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code >DerivativeApproximation</code> offers approximated
       derivatives of a discrete function. The symmetrization of the derivative
       tensor is now done at the right place, i.e. the derivative itself is
       symmetrized instead of an intermediate tensor. This should improve the
       results slightly, but cause no problems otherwise, as this is completely
       internal to the class.
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/08/03)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code >DataOut::build_patches</code> and similar
       functions in the related <code>DataOut*</code> classes allowed to pass
       zero as the second argument (denoting the number of threads to use if
       multithreading is enabled). This led to no output being created at
       all. This is now fixed by throwing an exception in this case.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/07/31)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The new function <code>FiniteElementBase</code>::<code>n_dofs_per_object</code> returns either
       <code>dofs_per_vertex</code>, <code>dofs_per_line</code>,
       <code>dofs_per_quad</code>, ..., depending on the explicitly
       specified function template argument. This is often useful for
       template trickery.

       (WB, 2006/07/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: <code >Triangulation&lt;dim&gt;::fix_coarsen_flags</code>
       has been modified to allow coarsening in all possible cases. Up
       to now, coarsening was forbidden, if the neighbor cell was not refined
       but had the <code>refine_flag</code> set, whereas it was allowed, if
       the neighbor cell already was refined. Now, in both cases coarsening is
       allowed (if all children are flagged for coarsening). This leeds to
       triangulations with a slightly reduced number of cells. In some cases
       older references will have to be updated.
       <br> 
       (Tobias Leicht 2006/06/22)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now new internal <code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;1,dim&gt;</code>::<code>lines()</code> and <code>TriaObjectAccessor&lt;2,dim&gt;</code>::<code>quads()</code> functions. By using these
       functions, 30 function specializations could be removed,
       significantly reducing code duplication.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/06/13)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Function <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>create_point_source_vector</code> to calculate the projection
       of a Dirac pulse on the base functions. This models a point source as
       used in the calculations of Green's functions and can also be used to
       extract the value of a finite element solution in a single point.

       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: Functions <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>point_value</code> and <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>point_difference</code> using the old interface
       without boundary mapping were replaced by wrapper functions
       calling the new versions.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/15)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The old version of <code>GridTools</code>::<code>find_active_cell_around_point</code> has been replaced
       by a wrapper function for backward compatibility. The wrapper calls the
       new version of this function, and it is highly recommended to use the new
       version as it automatically delivers also the local coordinate of the
       point (so it can save some computation time in most cases as you don't have
       to calculate that again).
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/12)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The functions <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>point_value</code> and <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>point_difference</code> now can also use arbitrary
       mappings, using the new <code>GridTools</code>::<code>find_active_cell_around_point</code> algorithm.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz, 2006/05/11)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: In <code>GridTools</code>, several functions have been added.
       <code>GridTools::find_closest_vertex</code> searches for the vertex
       located at closest distance to a given point. <code>
       GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex</code> allows to determine
       all cells adjacent to a given vertex. And finally, a new version of
       <code>find_active_cell_around_point</code>, which takes additionally
       a mapping as parameter, implements a new and faster algorithm to
       determine the active cell in which a given point is located. For
       points located on boundaries and edges, it is in most cases also able
       to give the finest cell.
       <br> 
       (Ralf B. Schulz 2006/05/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>DoFObjectAccessor::get_dof_values</code> and
       <code>DoFObjectAccessor::set_dof_values</code> were part of the
       accessors for lines, quads, and hexes. However, they could not
       be called for these objects unless the object was actually a
       cell, i.e. one could never call this function for a line or
       face in 3d, for example. The functions have therefore been
       moved to the <code>DoFCellAccessor</code> class that provides
       access to cells (i.e. lines in 1d, quads in 2d, and hexes in
       3d) for which this operation is actually useful.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/05/01)
       </p>
  
  <li> <p> Fixed: second derivatives where not computed correctly in <code>FEFaceValuesBase</code>, i.e. when evaluating
       second derivatives on faces of cells. This is now fixed. Using
       second derivatives evaluated at quadrature points within a cell
       was not affected by this problem.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/04/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The functions <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_line</code>,
       <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_quad</code>, and
       <code>Triangulation::clear_user_flags_hex</code> can be used to
       selectively clear only some of the user flags as needed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>VectorTools::project</code> functions can now
       also be used for vector arguments of type other than
       <code>Vector&lt;double&gt;</code>.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>GridTools::get_finest_common_cells</code> can be
       used to find those cells that are shared by two triangulations that are
       based on the same coarse mesh. This is useful, for example, when having
       to integrate the solution on one mesh against the shape functions on
       another mesh, a situation that frequently happens in time-dependent but
       also in nonlinear problems.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The function <code>GridTools::have_same_coarse_mesh</code> figures
       out whether two triangulations, two DoFHandlers, etc, are built on the
       same coarse mesh.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/04/14)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: Since calling <code>cell-&gt;get_dof_indices</code> is a
       fairly frequent operation (called about 7 times per cell in
       step-14, but much more often in more complicated programs), the
       results of this function are now cached for faster access.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/29)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: An exception was generated when trying to interpolate
       boundary values for a primitive component of a composite finite
       element that also has non-primitive base elements (for example,
       trying to interpolate boundary values for a the last component
       of a RT x Q1 element). This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is a new function <code>FiniteElement</code>::<code>face_to_equivalent_cell_index</code> that can
       convert a face index of a degree of freedom into a
       corresponding cell index.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There are now functions <code>VectorTools</code>::<code>point_value</code> that evaluate the value of a
       finite element function at a given point inside the domain.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p> Improved: <code>GridOut</code> now has functions for
       declaring and parsing parameters in a <code>ParameterHandler</code>, like used in <code>DataOut_Interface</code> for a long time.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/03/06)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>Triangulation</code>, <code>PersistentTriangulation</code>, <code>DoFHandler</code>, <code>hp::DoFHandler</code> and <code>MGDoFHandler</code> classes now all have a <code>dimension</code> variable which allows to ask
       the template argument <tt>dim</tt> by
       <code>SomeClass::dimension</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/27)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: When used, the copy constructor of <code>MappingQ</code> would lead to memory
       corruption. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/02/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code>StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code>mapping</code> object of type <code>MappingQ1</code> which is used in several parts
       of the library. This way multiple creation and storage of <code>MappingQ1</code> objects can be avoided.
       <br>
       Similar to <code>StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code>mapping</code> there is now also an object <code>hp::StaticMappingQ1</code>::<code>mapping_collection</code> of type <code>MappingCollection</code>.
       <br>
       (RH 2006/02/21)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a <code>GridOut</code>::<code>write_gmsh</code> function to write in the gmsh 
       format. It has the same features of the write_ucd one. 
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/02/17)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Changed: The <code>hp::FECollection</code>::<code>get_fe</code>, <code>hp::QCollection</code>::<code>get_quadrature</code> and <code>hp::MappingCollection</code>::<code>get_mapping</code> functions are now renamed to
       the standard <code>operator[]</code>
       function. Similarly, the <code>FECollection</code>::<code>n_finite_elements</code>, <code>QCollection</code>::<code>n_quadratures</code> and <code>MappingCollection</code>::<code>n_mappings</code> functions are now renamed to
       the standard <code>size()</code> function.

       (RH 2006/02/10)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>GridGenerator</code>::<code>half_hyper_ball</code> now is implemented also 
       in three dimensions, and the boundary now is colored with 0 and one 
       respectively on the curved and plane.
       <br> 
       (Luca Heltai 2006/02/07)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: <code>FiniteElementData</code> and
       <code>FiniteElement</code> now support the
       concept of blocks along with components. See the glossary for
       the difference.
       <br>
       (GK 2006/01/25)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>MGDoFHandler</code>::<code>distribute_dofs</code> and <code>renumber</code> functions could not handle
       coarsened grids (unused vertices, faces and cells). This is now
       fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2006/01/23)

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>Mapping</code> class and derived classes now have
       functions <code>clone()</code> that return a new object of the same
       (derived) type.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/1/8)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: The <code>KellyErrorEstimator</code> class now also allows to
       select the cells on which it is supposed to work by giving a material
       ID, instead of only a subdomain ID.
       <br> 
       (WB 2006/1/4)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Improved: A new <code>TriaAccessor::ExcCellHasNoChildren</code>
       exception will be raised if the <code>TriaObjectAccessor::child_index</code> function
       is invoked for cells without children.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/12/09)

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: We had a bug in <code>DataOut::build_patches</code>
       that, when used in multithreaded mode, caused an exception to be
       thrown. In particular, this happened when the step-14 program was run on
       dual processor machines and the library was compiled for
       multithreading. This is now fixed.

       (WB 2005/10/20)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code>Triangulation::get_boundary_indicators</code>
       function.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/30)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: There is now a new <code>GridTools::delete_unused_vertices</code>
       function. Previously a <tt>private</tt> function in <code>GridIn</code> it has now been moved to and made
       <tt>public</tt> in <code>GridTools</code>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/28)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       New: The <code>GridIn&lt;dim&gt;::read_netcdf(string
       &filename)</code> function reads grids from NetCDF files. The
       only data format currently supported is the <tt>TAU grid
       format</tt>.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/23)
       </p>

  <li> <p>
       Fixed: The <code>GridIn&lt;dim&gt;::read(filename, format)</code>
       function ran into an exception when called with
       <tt>Default</tt> format and a filename which does not include
       <tt>/</tt>. This is now fixed.
       <br> 
       (RH 2005/09/21)

made to the three sub-libraries <a href="#base">base</a>,

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <p>Removed: The <code>FullMatrix::add_diag</code> function was removed. It
  offered functionality of questionable use in the first place, and its
  implementation was correct only for matrices of size $3 \times 3$, $4 \times 4$
  and $8 \times 8$ without anyone noticing for 10 years. Consequently, it can't
  have been used very frequently.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/12/09)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: The namespace deal_II_numbers has been renamed dealii::numbers.
  The old name stemmed from a time when not everything was already in
  namespace <code>dealii</code>. The old name is retained via a namespace
  alias but is deprecated and will eventually be removed.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/11/02)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: When writing output files in UCD format using either the
  DataOutBase or the GridOut class, we used to write a preamble at the
  beginning of the file that included the date and time the file was created.
  However, several visualization programs get confused when confronted with
  comments at the beginning of UCD files. Rather than printing a sensible
  error message, they usually simply refuse to show any output, making it
  very hard to track down the actual cause.
  <br>
  The classes mentioned above previously allowed to suppress writing a preamble
  by setting a flag in the DataOutBase::UcdFlags or GridOutFlags::Ucd
  structures. Given how complicated it is to find the actual
  source of trouble, the default for these flags has been changed to not
  produce this preamble any more. If desired, the flag can be used to still
  produce a preamble.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/10/30)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: The version number of the deal.II intermediate format written by
  DataOutBase::write_deal_II_intermediate has been increased to 3 to accommodate the fact that
  we now support writing vector-valued data to output files in at least some output formats.
  (Previously, vector-valued date was written as a collection of scalar fields.) Since
  we can only read files written in intermediate format that has the same number as the
  files we generate, this means that files written with previous format numbers can now
  no longer be read.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/10/11)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: FilteredMatrix now can be applied to any matrix having the standard
  set of <code>vmult</code> functions. In order to achieve this, its interface
  had to be overhauled.
  Only the <code>VECTOR</code> template argument remains. Furthermore, instead of
  PreconditionJacobi being applied to FilteredMatrix, FilteredMatrix
  can now be applied to any preconditioner.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/09/25)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Changed: The deprecated typedefs
  <code>internal::Triangulation::Line</code>,
  <code>internal::Triangulation::Quad</code>, and
  <code>internal::Triangulation::Hexahedron</code> have been removed.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/09/07)
  </p>
</ol>



<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
<li> <p>New: step-33, written mainly by David Neckels,
  illustrates how the Euler equations of compressible inviscid gas
  dynamics can be solved. More generally, the program also provides
  a framework for the solution of arbitrary hyperbolic, nonlinear
  conservation laws.
  <br>
  (WB, 2008/05/23)
  </p>

<li> <p>Improved: step-16 has been updated to show the
  use of Multigrid with Dirichlet boundary conditions.
  <br>
  (GK, 2007/05/13)
  </p>

<li> <p>New: step-22, written by Martin Kronbichler and Wolfgang
     Bangerth, shows how to solve, and in particular how to solve
     efficiently, the Stokes equations that describe viscous
     incompressible fluid flow.
  <br>
  (WB, 2008/03/28)
  </p>

<li> <p>New: step-29 demonstrates how problems involving
  complex %numbers can be implemented by viewing real and imaginary parts
  of a complex-valued solution as the two components of a vector-valued
  function.
  <br>
  (Moritz Allmaras, 2007/10/31)
  </p>

<li> <p>New: A significantly simpler way to code the assembly of linear
  systems for problems with more than one solution variable has been
  implemented. This is explained in detail in the report on @ref vector_valued
  and tutorial programs step-20 and step-21
  have been converted as well.
  <br>
  (WB, 2008/02/23)
  </p>

  <li> <p>Improved: On Mac OS X, the operating system provides for
  "frameworks", which are essentially collections of shared libraries.
  We now link with the "Accelerate" framework (from Mac OS X 10.4
  onwards) or the "vecLib" framework (for previous versions) instead
  of the individual BLAS and LAPACK libraries if they are needed. This
  insulates us from having to use the actual name of these libraries,
  which may be subject to change, and it may also link with optimized
  or vectorized libraries if they are available.
  <br>
  (Eh Tan, WB 2007/10/22)
  </p>

</ol>



<a name="base"></a>
<h3>base</h3>

<ol>
<li> <p> New: The FunctionParser::default_variable_names() function returns
default names for variables in the given space dimension. For example, in
2d, this would be "x,y".
<br>
(WB 2008/05/12)
</p> </li>

<li> <p>New: ConvergenceTable::evaluate_convergence_rates has been incomplete
for a long time. An implementation for reduction_rate and
reduction_rate_log2 has been added in the case where one specifies
a reference column that allows to compute error rates also for local
refinement.
<br>
(Luca Heltai 2008/04/16)
</p></li>

<li> <p> Fixed: The Utilities::int_to_string function did not work for 5 or 6
digits, while its counterpart Utilities::needed_digits does. This is now fixed,
and the two are coherent.
<br>
(Luca Heltai 2008/04/16)
</p> </li>

<li> <p> New: The SymmetricTensor class now has a constructor that creates
an object from an array consisting its independent components.
<br>
(WB 2008/02/21)
</p> </li>

<li> <p> New: There are now output operators (i.e. <code>operator@<@<</code>)
for the SymmetricTensor class.
<br>
(WB 2008/02/12)
</p> </li>

<li> <p> Improved: LogStream is now thread safe and output lines from different
threads are separated now. Additionally, a function LogStream::log_thread_id()
has been added to log the id of the thread printing the message. The semantics
has slightly changed in that the header is now printed at the time when the line
is finished.
<br>
(GK 2008/01/22)
</p> </li>

<li> <p> New: There is a function Threads::this_thread_id() now returning
an integer id of the current thread.
<br>
(GK 2008/01/22)
</p> </li>

<li> <p> Improved: Quadrature now has an assignment operator.
<br>
(GK 2007/12/27)
</p> </li>

<li> <p>Fixed: MultithreadInfo::n_cpus now gives the correct result
  also on my Intel MacBook Pro.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2007/11/12)
  </p> </li>

  <li> <p>New: There is now a template numbers::NumberTraits that provides
  the means to implement linear algebra and other algorithms for both real
  and complex data types.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/11/03)
  </p> </li>

  <li> <p>New: The DataOutBase class and derived classes can now deal with data that is
  logically vector-valued, i.e. derived classes can pass down information that some of
  the components of the output should be grouped together as vectors, instead of being
  treated as a number of separate scalar fields. This allows visualization programs to
  display these components as vector-fields right away, without the need to manually group
  them together into a vector.
  <p>
  While all output format writers receive the information necessary to do this, currently
  only the VTK reader in DataOutBase::write_vtk as well as the deal.II
  intermediate format writer make use of it.
  <p>
  The use of this ability is explained in the step-22 and
  step-33 tutorial programs.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/10/11)
  </p> </li>

  <li> <p>New: Macro #AssertDimension introduced for easier handling of
  ExcDimensionMismatch.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/09/13)
  </p> </li>

</ol>



<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li> <p>Changed: A few simple PETSc wrappers for helper functions
  PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::transpose,
  PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::is_symmetric,
  PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::is_hermitian, and
  PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::write_ascii have been added.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2008/04/30)
  </p>

<li> Fixed: The SolverQMRS class could not deal with block vectors
and block matrices. This is now fixed.
<br>
(WB 2008/3/20)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The implementation of SparseILU::decompose was rather
inefficient in that it accessed random elements of the matrix in its
inner loop. It has been replaced by the algorithm given in the book
by Yves Saad: "Iterative methods for sparse linear systems", second
edition, in section 10.3.2. The code is now about 8 times faster than
before.
<br>
(WB 2008/2/29)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The implementation of SparseILU::vmult very needlessly called
SparseMatrix::vmult just to throw away the (nonsensical) result away
immediately. This is now fixed.
<br>
(WB 2008/2/27)
</li>

<li> New: The functionality print_gnuplot is now also available for sparsity
patterns derived from the class BlockSparsityPatternBase, e.g. for
BlockSparsityPattern in the same way as for general sparsity patterns.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler 2008/2/26)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::clear_row and
PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::clear_rows functions had a memory leak that made
PETSc become progressively slower over time. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Daniel Goldberg 2008/2/20)
</li>

<li> Improved: All GrowingVectorMemory objects that have the same template
argument will access the same memory pool. Therefore, it is now not a
crime any more to just create a memory pool and discard later. Furthermore,
logging of statistics has been switched off by default, such that linear
solvers remain silent.
<br>
(GK 2007/12/16)
</li>

<li> Fixed: Vector::operator/= can't work when the scaling factor is zero,
but it happened to check whether the factor was positive. That's of course
bogus, the check should have been whether it is non-zero. This has now been
fixed.
<br>
(WB 2007/11/03)
</li>

<li> New: A class ScaledMatrix was introduced which combines the vector operations of
an underlying matrix with a scaling.
<br>
(GK 2007/10/30)
</li>

<li> Improved: FilteredMatrix has an iterator now that allows users to access the
constraints individually.
<br>
(GK 2007/10/30)
</li>


</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>

  <li> <p> Improved: GridOutFlags::Gnuplot now takes an additional curved_inner_cells
  parameter. Similar to curved_inner_cells in DataOut this allows the output of interior
  cells with curved boundaries. This is useful for MappingQEulerian or similar mappings.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/05/12)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Fixed: Functions::FEFieldFunction<dim>.set_active_cell was declared
  inline in the declaration but not in the implementation. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2008/04/16)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The FE_RaviartThomasNodal now supports hp functionality.
  <br>
  (Zhu Liang, 2008/04/04)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: The StraightBoundary object Triangulation::straight_boundary
  is now made public. This allows to use Triangulation::straight_boundary instead
  of recreating a StraightBoundary object when needed.
  <br>
  (RH, 2008/04/04)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Extendend: SolutionTransfer has an additional template parameters DH
  for the dof handler class to use, which defaults to DoFHandler. However, an
  instantiation is also provided for hp::DoFHandler.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, 2008/04/03)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Extended: DataOut has an extended interface now which enables a user
  decision, which cells shall be written as curved cells using the provided
  mapping: none, only cells at the boundary, or all cells. The last choice can
  be useful when a mapping like MappingQEulerian is employed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, 2008/03/20)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Changed: From now on the SolutionTransfer class does not use any user
  pointers of the underlying Triangulation object. Thus several SolutionTransfer
  instances with different DoFHandler objects can be used simultaneously. It is
  no longer necessary to assemble all solution vectors into a new one with a
  combined DoFHandler.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, 2008/03/18)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: There is now a namespace DoFRenumbering::boost that contains the
  implementation of interfaces to three reordering strategies provided by the
  Boost Graph Library, namely DoFRenumbering::boost::Cuthill_McKee,
  DoFRenumbering::boost::king_ordering, and DoFRenumbering::boost::minimum_degree.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/03/07)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Changed: The DoFRenumbering class has been converted into a namespace.
  Since all its members were static, this hasn't changed anything fundamental
  and use of the functions therein should work in exactly the same way as before.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/03/07)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The new TriaObjectAccessor::set_all_boundary_indicators function
  does not only set the boundary indicator of the current object but of all that
  bound it as well. For example, in 3d, if TriaObjectAccessor::set_boundary_indicator
  is called on a face, then the boundary indicator of the 4 edges that bound the face
  remain unchanged. On the other hand, the boundary indicators of face and edges are
  all set at the same time using the new function.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/02/26)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: The tria pointer and the GridIn::debug_output_grid function
  are changed from private to protected to be accessible in derived classes.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/02/24)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The new Boundary::get_new_point_on_face and
  get_intermediate_points_on_face functions offer an dimension independent
  interface to the Boundary class.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/02/24)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: There is now a FEFaceValuesBase::get_face_index function which
  returns the index of the face selected the last time the reinit() function
  was called.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/02/15)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The MappingQEulerian class provides an arbitrary order Eulerian
  mapping where the nodes of a mesh are displaced by a previously computed
  vector field.
  <br>
  (Joshua White 2008/02/05)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The MappingQ class constructor now takes a parameter that determines
  whether a higher order mapping should also be used for interior cells. By default,
  the higher order mapping is only used for cells on the boundary; cells in the
  interior are bounded by straight edges described by a (bi-, tri-)linear mapping.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/02/05)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The function VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints computes
  the constraints that correspond to boundary conditions of the
  form $\vec u \cdot \vec n = 0$.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/01/23)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Fixed: Neither ConstraintMatrix::print nor ConstraintMatrix::write_dot
  produced any output for constraints of the form $x_i=0$, i.e. where the right
  hand side is a trivial linear combination of other degrees of freedom. This
  is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/01/23)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: GridGenerator::subdivided_hyper_rectangle now also colorizes
  cells according to the octant they are in.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/12/20)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>New: The DataOut, DataOutRotation, DataOutStack, and DataOutFaces
  can now deal with vector-valued data if the functions in DataOutBase
  that write in a particular graphical output format can deal with it.
  Previously, if a finite element field had more than one component,
  they were all output as logically independent scalar components;
  most visualization programs then allowed to display vector fields
  by composing them of individual scalar fields for each vector component.
  </p><p>
  With the new scheme, the DataOut_DoFData::add_data_vector() functions
  inherited by the classes listed above take an additional parameter
  that may be used to indicate that certain components of the data
  logically form a vector field. The output formats for which this
  is presently implemented then indicate this fact in the output file. The
  mechanism is shown in action in step-22 and
  step-33.
  <br>
  (WB 2007/10/14)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: UpdateFlags::update_q_points has been renamed to
  UpdateFlags::update_quadrature_points. Additional update flags for support
  points have been added without functionality, yet.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/10/12)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: The number of blocks of an FESystem was properly defined and the
  constructors changed accordingly. At least non of the test programs noticed the change.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/10/03)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Improved: In an effort to make names more consistent, second
  derivatives in FEValuesBase and UpdateFlags have been renamed to
  Hessians. Thus, the clash between the forms <tt>2nd</tt> and
  <tt>second</tt> has been removed. Old function and enum names are
  available for compatibility but have been marked deprecated.
  <br>
  (GK 2007/09/12)
  </p></li>

  <li> <p>Fixed+New: The GridOutFlags::Ucd and
  GridOutFlags::Msh structures now take a new parameter
  <code>write_lines</code> to output lines with boundary id different
  from 0 in three-dimensional meshes. This fixes an annoying bug for
  which meshes with ids different from zero where not written in a
  compatible way, and if re-read with the corresponding
  GridIn functions, would not yield the same mesh upon
  refinement.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2007/09/10)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li> <p>Extended: The possibilities of graphical output via the DataOut,
  DataOutFaces and DataOutRotation classes have been extended by the
  ability to perform a postprocessing step before a given data
  vector is written to the output. This way, derived variables can be
  written instead of the original data. To this end, there is a new
  version of DataOut_DoFData::add_data_vector taking a
  data vector and a DataPostprocessor, which performs the actual
  calculation of new data based on the values and possibly derivatives
  of the original data at each point of the patch.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2007/09/10)

<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the

</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The implementation of the reordering algorithms in the boost
  namespace created multiple edges between two nodes. The new implementation
  submits not more than one edge, but that affects the ordering of the
  degrees of freedom and deviates from previous behavior.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/04/22)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The files implementing the class ConstraintMatrix are now
  saved in the lac/ subdirectory, named <code>constraint_matrix.h</code>
  and included by the line <code>\#include
  @<lac/constraint_matrix.h@></code>. After all, constraints are just
  algebraic objects and do not depend on anything in the deal.II
  directory (in particular, they are dimension-independent).  The old
  <code>\#include @<dofs/dof_constraints.h@></code> include line is still
  enabled by a reference to the new file, but users should try to adapt
  their codes to the new file names as the reference might be removed in
  the future.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/03/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The function DoFTools::get_subdomain_association function used
  to assign degrees of freedom to the subdomain of the last cell on which
  the degree of freedom is a part. This introduced a bias for degrees of
  freedom's subdomains located on boundaries of subdomains, and
  consequently to unequal numbers of DoFs per subdomain even if the
  number of cells is roughly equal across subdomains. This behavior has
  been changed by assigning degrees of freedom pseudo-randomly to any of
  the subdomains on which they are located. This is a deviation from
  previous behavior, however.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, WB 2008/11/02)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The way we set up threads in the Threads::spawn functions
  and friends has been completely written, using the boost::bind and
  boost::function libraries. This has made things significantly simpler
  and allowed us to remove some 4,100 lines of code. The only
  user-visible side effect is that you can now no longer spawn
  functions with 10 arguments (this was the maximum before) whereas 9
  arguments continues to work; the reason for this is a limitation in
  the boost::bind library. This limit will be lifted with the next
  C++ standard, however, using variadic templates.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The SolutionTransfer class used to take a type as second
  template argument that denoted the scalar upon which Vector objects
  were built, in order to allow interpolating Vector@<float@> objects,
  for example. This argument has now been changed to a vector type,
  and been given a default of Vector@<double@>; however, one can
  now also pass in BlockVector objects, or objects of type
  PETScWrappers::Vector, etc. On the downside, the old
  SolutionTransfer::refine_interpolate function with only a single
  argument has been deleted since there is no reliable way to resize
  a vector unless it is a plain Vector@<double@>.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The FiniteElement::get_prolongation_matrix and
  FiniteElement::get_restriction_matrix functions now have an
  additional argument of type RefinementCase to enable a
  meaningful use of these matrices in case of anisotropic
  refinement. These matrices are used for solution transfer and
  multigrid operations, but there should be no need to use them
  in user codes directly. Note, that the matrices are not fully
  implemented for all finite elements up to now.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/07/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: <code>GeometryInfo::children_per_cell</code> has been
  replaced by GeometryInfo::max_children_per_cell, which
  represents the maximum number of children a cell might have,
  i.e. the number of children in the case of isotropic
  refinement. But note, that this number will rarely be needed in
  user codes. In general, the number of children of a cell varies
  from cell to cell and can be obtained by
  <code>cell->n_children()</code>, which gives the number of
  children of a specific <code>cell</code> which is refined iso-
  or anisotropically.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The analogous change applies to the number of children
  of a face. <code>GeometryInfo::subfaces_per_face</code> has
  been replaced by GeometryInfo::max_children_per_face, which
  represents the maximum number of children a face might have,
  i.e. the number of children in the case of an isotropic refined
  face.  But note, that this number will rarely be needed in user
  codes. In general, the number of children of a face varies from
  face to face and can be obtained by
  <code>face->n_children()</code>, which gives the number of
  children of a specific <code>face</code> which is refined iso-
  or anisotropically.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face function is
  generalized to anisotropic refinement and has now an additional
  RefinementCase argument. This function will rarely be used in
  user codes, as e.g. the neighbor's child at a specific face and
  subface should be accessed through
  <code>cell->neighbor_child_on_subface</code> rather than
  through the GeometryInfo::child_cell_on_face function.

  New: A new tutorial program  step-34 was added to the

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: Some parts of the library used to use classes and functions
  from the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST</a> library. Since
  many of the components of BOOST have been voted into what will be the
  next C++ standard, we now use a namespace std_cxx1x (coined on the
  provisional name C++0x used for the next C++ standard) into which we
  import BOOST components as necessary. If a compiler supports C++0x,
  we can then later replace BOOST components by elements from namespace
  <code>std</code> in one central place, rather than all throughout the
  code.

  Updated: The version of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/">BOOST</a>

  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/07)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Based on work by Cataldo Manigrasso and Luca Heltai
  developed over the last few months on a branch, deal.II now
  supports meshes that are embedded in higher space
  dimensions. This allows, for example, to solve equations on
  the surface of a sphere (e.g. to use boundary element
  methods for exterior problems).
  <br>
  In practice, this is implemented by giving a large number
  of classes a second template argument. Whereas the first one,
  typically named <code>dim</code> still denotes the dimensionality
  of the triangulation (e.g. <code>dim=2</code> for triangulations
  of quadrilaterals, or <code>dim=3</code> for those made
  up of hexahedra), the second template argument <code>spacedim</code>
  denotes the dimensionality of the space this all is embedded in.
  As a consequence, if one wants to have a triangulation of a
  two-dimensional manifold in three-dimensional space, one would
  use <code>dim=2, spacedim=3</code> as template arguments.
  <br>
  In order to remain backward compatible, the new second template
  argument always has a default value that equals <code>dim</code>
  meaning it is still sufficient to write <code>Triangulation@<2@></code>
  if you intend two-dimensional triangulations of two-dimensional
  domains.
  <br>
  The new functionality is described in the step-34
  tutorial program.
  <br>
  (Cataldo Manigrasso, Luca Heltai 2008/12/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The various accessor classes have been rewritten entirely.
  Where previously we had these accessor classes as separate
  specializations for 1d, 2d, and 3d, each implementing the same
  set of functions, these classes have now all been merged into
  common templates TriaAccessor, DoFAccessor, and MGDoFAccessor,
  along with the existing CellAccessor, DoFCellAccessor and
  MGDoFCellAccessor. As a result, the documentation of individual
  functions should now be much easier to find.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/05)

  New: In analogy to the existing interfaces to the PETSc library, there

  New: The shared libraries we create are now versioned, i.e. they have

  the preprocessor flag <code>DEAL_II_COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MPI</code> is now set in

  New: There is now a class TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern that allows to

  Changed: The SparseDirectUMFPACK class now calls the umfpack_dl_* routines

  <br>
  (Moritz Allmaras 2008/10/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The SparseILU::initialize function, for some reason, required
  the second argument, SparseILU::AdditionalParameters, to be present even
  if it is a default constructed object. This argument now has a default value
  that equates to a default constructed object that can therefore be omitted
  when so desired.

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: VectorTools::integrate_difference now works also on codimension one grids.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2009/04/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The ConstraintMatrix class can now also handle inhomogeneous
  constraints. This means that e.g. Dirichlet boundary conditions are now a
  special case of algebraic constraints. There are new condense functions
  that simultaneously act on matrices and vectors for use of this feature.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/02/25)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component and
  DoFTools::count_dofs_per_block erroneously resized the output argument
  to the number of components or blocks in the finite element, respectively,
  even if the target component/block list given as an additional argument
  needed a different number of output elements. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/02/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The GridGenerator::half_hyper_shell function now also exists in 3d.
  However, to use it with the HalfHyperShellBoundary class, one has to
  pass inner and outer radii to the constructor.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB, 2009/01/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The restriction and embedding matrices for FE_Q are now implemented.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The GeometryInfo::cell_to_child_coordinates and
  GeometryInfo::child_to_cell_coordinates functions are extended to
  anisotropic refinement.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: There were cases with both anisotropic refinement and non-standard
  line orientation where we created wrong meshes in 3d. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH, 2008/12/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The FEValuesExtractors classes were not copyable though there
  are legitimate reasons to do so. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/17)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The MappingQEulerian function was not thread-safe. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The functions FETools::lexicographic_to_hierarchic_numbering and
  FETools::hierarchic_to_lexicographic_numbering now also exist in variants
  returning their result by value, rather than through their last argument.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: FEValues objects can now directly calculate the Laplacians of
  solution functions at quadrature points. This is equivalent to the
  trace of the Hessians, but faster and more convenient in user code.
  step-31 program has also been updated to use this.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The FEValuesViews objects that one gets when writing things
  like <code>fe_values[velocities]</code> have acquired the ability to
  extract individual components of solutions at quadrature points by
  writing code like
  <code>fe_values[velocities].get_function_values (global_solution,
  local_velocity_values)</code>. See the new section at the end of the
  @ref vector_valued module for an overview of this facility. The
  step-31 program has also been updated to use this.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: The FEValuesViews objects that one gets when writing things
  like <code>fe_values[velocities]</code> (see @ref vector_valued) have
  become a lot smarter. They now compute a significant amount of data
  at creation time, rather than on the fly. This means that creating such
  objects becomes more expensive but using them is cheaper. To offset this
  cost, FEValuesBase objects now create all possible FEValuesViews objects
  at creation time, rather than whenever you do things like
  <code>fe_values[velocities]</code>, and simply return a reference to a
  pre-generated object. This turns an $O(N)$ effort into an $O(1)$
  effort, where $N$ is the number of cells.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/12/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Upgraded: The FunctionParser classes now use version 2.83 of the fparser
  library.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2008/12/08)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridGenerator::laplace_transform would only do at most 1000
  iterations in its solver, irrespective of the actual number of nodes to
  be moved around. This is now fixed: the maximum number now equals the
  number of nodes.
  <br>
  (Luca D'Auria 2008/12/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The function DoFTools::make_zero_boundary_constraints() computes the
  constraints that result from requiring the degrees of freedom at the
  boundary to be zero. Use cases are when the sparsity pattern is not known
  / not wanted / not inaccessible.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2008/12/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Updated: The function ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global() for
  matrices does now use row-wise addition into sparse matrices, which
  accelerates the transfer from local to global data.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB 2008/11/27)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values function was implemented a bit
  clumsily and was using much more time than necessary. This should be fixed now.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/11/25)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridIn::read_msh function had a bug that made it reject
  MSH input files if they contained type-15 cells with more than one
  associated vertex.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/11/05)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee algorithm had a bug when applied
  to MGDoFHandler objects and if the <code>reverse</code> flag was set. This
  should now be fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/31)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() also for PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockSparseMatrix.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister 2008/10/27)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: When calling function DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern with a ConstraintMatrix, it is now possible to set a bool argument keep_constrained_dofs. When this flag is set to false, constrained rows and columns will not be part of the sparsity pattern, which increases the performance of matrix operations and decrease memory consumption in case there are many constraints.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/10/21)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a second DoFTools::count_dofs_with_subdomain_association function that
  calculates the number of degrees of freedom associated with a certain subdomain and
  splits the result up according to the vector component of each degree of freedom. This
  function is needed when splitting block matrices in parallel computations.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridOut::write_gnuplot function had a bug that made it output only the
  very first cell. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/09)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The GridIn::read_msh function can now read version 2 of the MSH format described
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/doc/texinfo/gmsh_10.html">here</a>.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: In rare cases, when Triangulation::limit_level_difference_at_vertices
  is passed to the constructor of the Triangulation class, meshes could be
  generated that do not honor this flag. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/10/06)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The class FE_Q can now alternatively be constructed based on
  support points from a given one-dimensional quadrature rule.
  <br>
  (Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler, 2008/09/07)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: Using the ConstraintMatrix class, when a degree of freedom was
  constrained against another DoF, and that other DoF was constrained to
  be equal to zero (i.e. the trivial linear combination of a third set of
  degrees of freedom), an exception resulted. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: It is now possible to get the inverse of the Jacobian
  matrix from the transformation form the real to the unit cell by
  using FEValues::inverse_jacobian.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2008/08/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is a second GridTools::partition_triangulation
  function that takes a cell connectivity pattern as argument, rather
  than computing it itself as the existing function. Use cases are
  discussed in the documentation of the new function.
  <br>
  (WB 2008/08/06)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex had a bug that
  prevented its correct functioning in three dimensions. Some
  cases were left out due to uncorrect assumptions on the various
  refinement possibilities.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2008/07/17)
  </p>

  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  Triangulation::prevent_distorted_boundary_cells function which is
  only useful in case of anisotropic refinement. At the boundary
  of the domain, the new point on the face may be far inside the
  current cell, if the boundary has a strong curvature. If we
  allow anistropic refinement here, the resulting cell may be
  strongly distorted, especially if it is refined again later
  on. To prevent this problem, this function flags such cells for
  isotropic refinement. It is called automatically from
  Triangulation::prepare_coarsening_and_refinement. Therefore
  this should have no effect on user codes.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/08/02)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new Triangulation::create_children function
  which actually sets up the children of a cell and updates the
  neighbor information. This work has been done in
  Triangulation::execute_refinement so far. Memory allocation has
  to be done prior to the function call. However, this is really
  something internal to the library and there should never be the
  need to use this function in user_codes. Calling
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement will be all
  you need.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: A part of the functionality of Triangulation::execute_coarsening has been implemented in a new way
  and shifted to the new function Triangulation::coarsening_allowed. This function decides,
  depending on the refinement situation of all a cells neighbors, if the
  cell may be coarsened, in which case the bool value <code>true</code> is
  returned. This is a functionality which is partly dimension dependend.
  <br>
  However, there should never be any reason to use this function in user codes.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new CellAccessor::neighbor_is_coarser function,
  which returns a bool value <code>true</code>, if the requested
  neighbor is a coarser one and <code>false</code> if the
  neighbor is as refined as the current cell. This new
  functionality is needed in the internals of the library to
  decide, if <code>neighbor_of_neighbor</code> or
  <code>neighbor_of_coarser_neighbor</code> has to be
  called. This decision is trivial in case of isotropic
  refinement, where the level of the cell and its neighbor is all
  the information needed. In case of aniostropic refinement, this
  new function can be used.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  <code>Triangulation::MeshSmoothing::allow_anisotropic_smoothing</code>
  smoothing flag for triangulations. An important part of the
  smoothing process for refinement and coarsen flags is to
  ensure, that no double refinement takes places at any face. If
  a cell is refined twice, its neighbor has to be refined at
  least once. However, technically it is not always necessary to
  refine the neighbor isotropically, it may be sufficient to
  choose only one direction for the refinement. While this allows
  to reduce the number of newly created cells to a minimum, it is
  incompatible with older versions of the library, as anisotropic
  refinement takes place, even if all the explicitly set
  refinement flags ask for isotropic refinement.
  <br>
  Therefore this functionality is off by default. However, in order to use
  the new feature of anisotropic refinement to full extend, this flag should
  be set explicitly.
  <br>
  Note, that for reasons of backwards compatibility this flag is
  NOT included in the general <code>MeshSmoothing::maximum_smoothing</code>
  flag.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2006/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new
  TriaObjectAccessor::clear_refinement_case function.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/19)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended: The CellAccessor::neighbor_of_neighbor function is
  now extended to anisotropic refinement.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended (internal): Lines on <code>level>0</code> have always
  been stored pairwise. In order to allow the creation of single
  interior lines we now also allow storage of single lines. The
  <tt>TriangulationLevel<1>::reserve_space</tt> function
  now takes an additional <code>n_consecutive_lines</code>
  parameter which allows to create new single as well as pairs
  for lines <code>n_consecutive_lines=1</code> or
  <code>n_consecutive_lines=2</code>, respectively.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/12/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: When allowing anisotropic refinement it cannot be
  guaranteed that all children of a cell are stored in
  consecutive components of the TriaLevel::cells vector,
  respectively. It is only known that children are stored at
  least in pairs. Therefore, it is not sufficient any more to
  store the index of the first child of a cell, only. Now the
  indices of every second child, i.e. of the even numbered
  children, must be stored.  For this, the
  TriaObjectAccessor::set_children function for cells now has a
  new argument representing the number of the child for which the
  index shall be set. This function can only be called for even
  numbered children. The same applies to the respective function
  for faces.
  <br>
  Finally, we note that these functions are for internal use,
  only.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The CellAccessor::refine_flag_set function now returns
  a RefinementCase argument instead of a boolean. Be aware, that
  you now still can ask <code>if(!cell->refine_flag_set())</code>
  , <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==false)</code> and
  <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set())</code> , but you cannot ask
  <code>if(cell->refine_flag_set()==true)</code> any more.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Extended: The CellAccessor::set_refine_flag function now has a
  new RefinementCase argument which defaults to
  <tt>GeometryInfo<dim>::isotropic_refinement</tt>.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/03/03)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new class RefinementCase defined in
  <code>geometry_info.h</code>, which allows to describe all
  possible (anisotropic and isotropic) refinement cases in (1,) 2
  and 3 dimensions.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new TriaObjectAccessor::n_children function
  which returns the number of children of the cell or face it was
  invoked for.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new TriaObjectAccessor::refinement_case
  function which returns the RefinementCase a cell or face is
  refined with.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New (for internal use only): There is now a new
  TriaObjectAccessor::set_refinement_case function. This function
  is mainly for internal use (required by
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement). It is not
  provided for <code>dim=1</code> as there the refinement case
  defaults to isotropic refinement.
  <br>
  Note, that users should still use the
  CellAccessor::set_refine_flag function for setting the
  RefinementCase of cells to be refined within the next
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement function.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: New <code>vector@<RefinementCase@> refinement_cases</code>
  vectors have been introduced in TriaObjects. For memory
  efficiency (but with a penalty on run-time) they might be
  replaced by <code>vector@<vector@<bool@> @> (dim, vector@<bool@>
  (n_quads/n_hexes))</code>, later.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/07/08 as of branch_anisotropic at 2005/02/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: When using a higher order mapping of degree at least 3 (i.e.
  the MappingQ class) on meshes that have cells with non-standard
  face orientation and that touch the boundary of the domain, then
  some interpolation points were wrongly computed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, Timo Heister, WB 2008/06/10)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The ParameterHandler::get_integer function now throws an
  exception when called for non-integer parameters. This exception has
  been commented out some time ago but is now reincluded.
  <br>
  (RH 2008/06/11)
  </p>
  </li>

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>
  Removed: The class TrilinosWrappers::SolverBlock and
  TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBlock have been deleted for compatibility
  reasons with Trilinos 10.2. These solvers can be exchanged by deal.II's
  own iterative solvers with block matrices and vectors without loss in
  performance.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2010/06/24)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The SparseMatrix::operator() used to always check that an entry
  exists when accessing it. If it didn't, it would throw an exception that
  could be caught in a user program. Since these accesses are very frequent,
  this check now only happens in debug mode when the program aborts if a
  nonexistent element is accessed. If you access a nonexistent element in
  optimized mode, anything might happen (as in many other functions if
  input arguments do not satisfy their constraints).
  <br>
  (WB 2010/06/04)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Removed: The interface to PETSc has been simplified to better handle
  incremental changes in PETSc versions and accommodate changes in
  functionality between versions. As a part of this process, the
  deal.II configure script no longer handles PETSc versions
  &lt;2.3.0. Attempting to configure deal.II with PETSc versions that are
  not supported will result in the error message, "Unknown PETSc
  version". The usage of the PETScWrappers are otherwise not affected
  by this change.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2010/03/06)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Removed: The class TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionStokes has been deleted
  because it did not work properly, and it is too specific to be part of
  the general library. A preconditioner that has the same properties is
  explained in the @ref step_31 step-31 tutorial program.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler 2009/11/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Changed: The class MGSmootherRelaxation now instead of a
  preconditioner takes a relaxation method with the functions
  <code>step</code> and <code>Tstep</code>. These perform a complete
  relaxation step, thus saving an auxiliary vector and computational
  effort for Gauss-Seidel type methods.

  While all relaxation preconditioners have been provided with the new
  two functions, you may have used MGSmootherRelaxation with your own
  preconditioner. In that case, you have two options:
  <ol>
    <li> Configure deal.II with <tt>--enable-mgcompatibility</tt>,
    which restores the old behavior of MGSmootherRelaxation.
    <li> Use MGSmootherPrecondition, which does what
    MGSmootherRelaxation did before.

<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
   <li>
   <p>
   New: The new tutorial program step-45,
   contributed by Markus B&uuml;rg, shows how to implement periodic boundary
   conditions.
   <br>
   (Markus B&uuml;rg, 2010/06/23)
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Improved: Exception classes declared locally to another class using
   DeclException0 through DeclException5 were previously shown as local
   classes in the class overview of the library. This was annoying since
   they were not really of interest but made up most of the list.
   The documentation now shows them in one central place in the
   @ref Exceptions module.
   <br>
   (WB 2010/04/26)

   Improved: We now compile all files with their full path name on the command

   Improved:
          Over the last few months, the multigrid implementation has seen
          significant rewrites, with much of the work done by B&auml;rbel
          Janssen. The goal &mdash; now achieved &mdash; was to finally fully
          support multigrid also for continuous finite elements on adaptively
          refined meshes (uniformly refined meshes and discontinuous elements
          have worked for a long time). As part of this process,
	  step-16 has
          been rewritten and now solves the same problem
	  step-6 solves, just
          with a multigrid solver.

   New: There is now a new tutorial program, step-35,

   New: A report has been added on the
   <a href="http://www.dealii.org/reports/codimension-one/desimone-heltai-manigrasso.pdf"
   target="body">codimension one</a> capabilities
   of the library (by Antonio DeSimone, Luca Heltai
   and Cataldo Manigrasso, SISSA, Trieste, Italy). It
   explains in detail how to use the
   library for the solution of problems defined on codimension
   one manifolds, such as, for example, %Boundary Element Methods.
   <br>

   <li>
   <p>
   New: The configure switch <code>--with-cpu=...</code> now allows the value
   <code>native</code>, indicating that we would like the compiler to figure
   out which CPU we are running on and optimize for it. The resulting
   libraries may not work on other (previous generation) processors, however.
   <br>

   <li>
   <p>
   Fixed: step-31 had a bug in the computation of the
   global scaling parameter in the function that evaluates the artificial
   viscosity: we computed
   $c(\mathbf{u},T) =
    c_R\ \|\mathbf{u}\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \ \mathrm{var}(T)
    \frac{1}{|\mathrm{diam}(\Omega)|^{\alpha-2}}$
   when it should have been
   $c(\mathbf{u},T) =
    c_R\ \|\mathbf{u}\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \ \mathrm{var}(T)
    \ |\mathrm{diam}(\Omega)|^{\alpha-2}$. This didn't matter much in this
   program because $\mathrm{diam}(\Omega)=2^{1/\textrm{dim}}$ and so is close
   to one. It would matter, however, if the domain had been different, as
   it is, for example, in the future step 32.

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: When using Trilinos wrapper objects in %parallel through MPI, each
   object now uses a separate and distinct MPI communicator object. This
   ensures that different objects (such as different matrices, or different
   vectors) communicate on separate channels, thereby simplifying debugging
   and possibly the parallelization of programs.

   (Toby D. Young, WB 2009/07/29)
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: When configuring to use METIS for partitioning meshes in %parallel,
   the METIS header files had to be modified by hand. In addition, with some
   MPI implementations one would get into trouble if <code>mpi.h</code>
   included <code>mpicxx.h</code>. These two problems have now been
   worked around.
   <br>
   (WB 2009/07/06)
   </p>

   <li>
   <p>
   New: As a primary means of parallelizing programs, deal.II now uses
   a task-based, rather than thread-based approach, in which one
   uses a high-level description of <i>what</i> needs to be done,
   rather than how these jobs have to be mapped onto threads. We then
   use the <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org">Threading
   Building Blocks (TBB) library</a> to schedule tasks onto available
   hardware resources. This new scheme of describing parallism and
   various abstractions to make programming in this framework easier
   are described in great detail in the
   @ref threads "Parallel computing with multiple processors" module.
   In addition, most of the parallelism already used within deal.II
   has been converted to use tasks, rather than threads, and so have
   some of the tutorial programs.
   <br>
   (WB 2009/01/09)
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: The support for threading has been completely re-written. In
   particular, the Threads::spawn functions have been deprecated, and
   new functions Threads::new_thread have been introduced.
   Threading is now discussed in a lot of detail in the
   @ref threads "Parallel computing with multiple processors" module.
   <br>
   (WB 2009/01/09)
   </p>
   </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: Previously, one had to give the two flags
   <code>--enable-multithreading --with-multithreading</code> to
   <code>./configure</code> to enable thread usage throughout the library.
   This has now been simplified: only the flag <code>--enable-threads</code>
   is now necessary. Furthermore, since most current machines have multiple
   cores these days, the default is now to use threads. This can be switched
   off using <code>--disable-threads</code>, however.

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a specialization Tensor<0,dim> of tensors of rank 0. Since rank-0

  <li>
    <p>
    Improved: The Vector class has been equipped with an improved way to

  <li>
    <p>
    Improved: The ConstraintMatrix class now uses a cache for random access to
    the constraint lines. This considerably increases performance of the

    Fixed: When using the TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector::reinit() function with a %parallel

  for arguments of type hp::DoFHandler.
  <br>
  (Markus B&uuml;rg 2009/10/01)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><p>New: The class BlockInfo stores and computes all BlockIndices objects related to
  DoFHandler and MGDoFHandler based on FESystem.
  <br>
  (GK 2009/09/13)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><p>Improved: MGDoFHandler now also has a typedef for MGDoFHandler::Container
  <br>
  (GK 2009/09/13)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li><p> FETools::compute_block_renumbering() can nor return block sizes instead of
  start indices.
  <br>
  (GK 2009/08/26)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The function GridGenerator::truncated_cone() and the class ConeBoundary
  can now be used to describe conical objects.
  <br>
  (Markus B&uuml;rg 2009/08/17)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Instead of asking face or edge iterators for their boundary indicator
  using TriaAccessor::boundary_indicator() and then the triangulation for
  the boundary object using Triangulation::get_boundary(), you can now directly
  ask the iterator for the boundary object using TriaAccessor::get_boundary().
  <br>
  (WB 2009/07/31)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The CellAccessor::recursively_set_material_id function did not
  set the material id for all children, but only for the first two, which
  is obviously a bug. This should now be fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/07/14)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The GridIn class sometimes had problems with input files that had
  whitespace at the end of lines. This should now be fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/07/10)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Previously, the Triangulation::create_triangulation
  function silently accepted input meshes with inverted cells
  (i.e. cells with a zero or negative determinant of the Jacobian of
  the mapping from the reference cell to the real cell). This can been
  changed now: By passing the appropriate flag to the constructor of
  the Triangulation class, the Triangulation::create_triangulation
  function checks whether cells are distorted or
  inverted, and may throw an exception containing a list of cells
  for which this is the case. If you know that this is harmless, for
  example if you have cells with collapsed vertices in your mesh but
  you do not intend to integrate on them, then you can catch and
  ignore this message. In all other cases, the output of your
  computations are likely to be wrong anyway.
  <br>
  The same is true for the Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement
  function: if it creates cells that are distorted, it throws a list of cells
  whose children are distorted.
  <br>
  The whole issue is described in some detail in the entry on
  @ref GlossDistorted "distorted cells" in the glossary.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/06/29)
  </p>
  </li>


  <li>
  <p>
  New: The new hp::DoFHandler::set_active_fe_indices function allows
  to distribute all active FE indices at once based on a given
  vector. This might be useful if this information is stored
  somewhere and has to be reconstructed or else if two DoFHandler
  objects with the same FE index distribution should be created.
  There is now also a corresponding
  hp::DoFHandler::get_active_fe_indices function.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH 2009/06/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The projection of quadrature points to subfaces in
  MappingQ in case of 3d anisotropic refinement did not respect
  non-standard face orientation/flip/rotation cases. This
  has now been fixed.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH 2009/06/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The new Triangulation::n_raw_faces() function forwards
  to Triangulation::n_raw_lines() in 2d and
  Triangulation::n_raw_quads() in 3d.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH 2009/06/12)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a new DataOutFaces::build_patches function which
  takes a Mapping argument. For higher order mappings this allows to
  represent curved boundaries by using more subdivisions. This function
  is also useful in the context of MappingQ1Eulerian.
  <br>
  (Tobias Leicht, RH 2009/06/05)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: For empty triangulations the new Triangulation::set_mesh_smoothing
  function allows to override the MeshSmoothing given to the constructor.
  <br>
  (RH 2009/06/05)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The new function TriaAccessor::is_translation_of computes
  whether a cell, face, or edge is a translation of another.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB 2009/05/19)
  </p>
  </li>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern functions have acquired a
  new paramater <code>subdomain_id</code>. If a value other than the
  default value is passed for it, the function only assembles the
  sparsity pattern on those cells that have the given subdomain id.
  This is useful, for example, in conjunction with the
  TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern class that can hold a sparsity
  pattern distributed across several MPI processes; in that case, it is
  not necessary that each process builds the entire sparsity pattern.
  <br>
  (WB 2009/04/29)
  </p>
  </li>

   <li>
   <p>
   Fixed: The DoFRenumbering::component_wise function for MGDoFHandler objects
   did a few things in %parallel that weren't thread-safe. This is now fixed.
   <br>
   (WB, 2009/01/20)
   </p>

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: The two DataOut::build_patches, DataOutFaces::build_patches, and
   DataOutRotation::build_patches functions have lost the argument
   that indicated the number of threads with which they should build the
   intermediate representation. This is something that now happens
   transparently in the background and doesn't need caller input any more.
   <br>
   (WB 2008/12/16)
   </p>

   <li>
   <p>
   Changed: The KellyErrorEstimator::estimate functions had a parameter
   that indicates the number of threads to be used in the computation.
   This parameter continues to exist for compatibility, but is now ignored.
   Rather, the number of threads is determined automatically by scheduling
   the requested computations on available compute resources.
   <br>
   (WB, 2008/12/29)
   </p>

   <li>
   <p>
   New: The new function internal::hp::FEValuesBase::get_fe_collection function
   allows to query the finite element collection currently in used in an hp::FEValues,
   hp::FEFaceValues, or hp::FESubfaceValues object.
   <br>
   (WB 2008/09/30)
   </p>

   <li>
   <p>
   New: The new function FEValuesBase::get_update_flags allows to query
   the update flags that are currently set on an FEValues, FEFaceValues, or
   FESubfaceValues object.
   <br>
   (WB 2008/09/29)

Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.

<ol>
  <li>None.

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
  <p>Fixed: The step-33 tutorial program can not be built with GCC versions
  4.5.x. There are in fact two problems, one that pertains to uses of
  <code>std::make_pair</code> that don't work any more with the upcoming
  C++ 1x standard that GCC 4.5.x already follows, and some in which the
  Trilinos package Sacado is incompatible with GCC 4.5.x, at least up to
  Trilinos version 10.4.0. While the latter problem can only be fixed in
  future Trilinos versions, at least the former problem is solved in step-33.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/18)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: GCC version 3.4.0 failed to compile the file
  <code>deal.II/source/numerics/matrices.cc</code> with
  an internal compiler error. This has
  now been worked around.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/15)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: A problem in the Makefiles caused error messages when
  building under CygWin.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/07/12)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: GCC version 3.3.x failed to compile the files
  <code>lac/include/lac/precondition_block.h</code>,
  <code>deal.II/source/multigrid/mg_dof_handler.cc</code> and
  <code>examples/step-34/step-34.cc</code>. These problems have
  now been worked around.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/12)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: Some older 3.x versions of GCC crashed compiling the functions in
  namespace DoFRenumbering::boost. There is now a configuration time test
  that checks that the compiler accepts the constructs in question. If the
  compiler does not, then these functions are disabled.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/01)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: Linking with more than one of the deal.II 1d, 2d, or 3d libraries
  when using static libraries did not work. This is now fixed. However, due to
  GCC bug <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=10591"
  target="_top">10591</a>, GCC versions prior to and including 4.1.x will
  still not work. Working with shared libraries was not and is not affected
  by this problem.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/01)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: GCC version 4.0.1 had a bug that prevented it from compiling
  release 6.3.0 because it apparently had an infinite loop allocating
  memory when compiling <code>fe_values.cc</code> in optimized mode. This
  problem had been fixed in GCC 4.0.2, but some versions of Mac OS X still use
  this GCC version in their Xcode environment. In any case, the code in
  deal.II has been changed to avoid this problem.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/06/30)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: Configuring with an external BOOST version did not work when
  using shared libraries since the test ran in the wrong order with respect
  to another configure test. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Bradley Froehle 2010/06/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: deal.II release 6.3.0 did not compile with Trilinos versions 9.x and
  10.0. This is now fixed.

  since its implementation used a class that was only forward declared
  and not visible at the point of instantiations in user code. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/16)

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: On some systems and compilers, the library could not be compiled

<p style="color:red">

deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

<li> The public member variable Quadrature::n_quadrature_points has
been removed after being deprecated for nearly three
years. Quadrature.size() replaces its function, and the new version
more naturally preserves consistency.
<br>
(GK 2010/11/11)
</li>

<li>
        deal.II has had a somewhat quirky directory and library structure for
        historical reasons, but this has now changed: All include and source
        files are now under the top-level <code>include/</code>
        and <code>source</code> directories. Furthermore, we no longer build a
        plethora of libraries but only <code>libdeal_II.g.so</code> (debug
        version) and <code>libdeal_II.so</code> (optimized version). In
	particular, we no longer build different versions of the library for
	different space dimensions.
	<br>
	As a consequence, if your makefile makes any assumption on the
	location of deal.II include files or the name of the deal.II library
	it will need to be changed. The sample Makefiles have been
	updated for this.
	<br>
	(WB 2010/10/25)
	</li>

<li> The <code>Polynomials::Lagrange::generate_complete_basis</code>
function has been renamed to Polynomials::generate_complete_Lagrange_basis .
The function was previously the only member of a class, and a static
one on top of that, which did not make much sense.
<br>
(WB 2010/10/22)</li>

<li> The <code>QGauss2, QGauss3, ..., QGauss7</code> classes &mdash; deprecated
for more than 6 years already &mdash; have finally been removed.
You should use code like <code>QGauss@<dim@>(4)</code> instead.
<br>
(WB 2010/09/19)</li>


<li> The FE_Nedelec class had previously implemented the lowest order
when the value 1 was passed to the constructor. This has now been
adjusted: the lowest order now results from passing 0, making this
consistent with the FE_RaviartThomas class and following the convention
used in by Brezzi and Raviart (though not in the original paper of
Nedelec).
<br>
(Markus B&uuml;rg 2010/09/14)</li>

<li> The fields DoFHandler::tria and DoFHandler::selected_fe are now
private instead of protected. Inheriting classes can only access them
through DoFHandler::get_tria() and DoFHandler::get_fe(), respectively.
<br>
(GK 2010/08/16)</li>

</ol>


<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p>New: The new step-38 program shows how to discretize and solve
  partial differential equations posed on curved manifolds embedded in
  higher dimensional spaces.
  <br>
  (Andrea Bonito, M. Sebastian Pauletti, 2011/01/02)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: deal.II now has a Qt based graphical user interface to edit
  input parameter files for the ParameterHandler class. The executable is
  located in <code>lib/bin/dealii_parameter_gui</code>.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann, 2010/12/20)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: A significant number of classes, primarily in the
  <code>base/</code> subdirectory, now provide the necessary member functions
  for serialization through BOOST's serialization library.
  <br>
  (Pradeep Rao, WB, 2010/12/06)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: A good number of problems associated with meshes that are
  embedded in a higher space dimension (i.e. where <code>dim @< spacedim</code>)
  are now fixed.
  <br>
  (Sebastian Pauletti, Andrea Bonito, Luca Heltai, WB, 2010/12/06)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Updated: The version of the <a href="http://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org">Threading
  Building Blocks (TBB)</a> shipped with deal.II has been updated
  to release 3.0 Update 3 (Commercially aligned version).
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/18)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: While 2d and 3d could mostly be handled with the
  same code, dimension-independent programming was always a bit
  different because the faces of 1d cells (i.e. vertices) did not
  have appropriate iterators defined. This has now been changed:
  there is now a class TriaAccessor<0,1,spacedim> (and corresponding
  DoFAccessor<0,DH>) that allows to write things like
  @code
    cell->face(0)->boundary_indicator();
    cell->face(1)->at_boundary();
    cell->face(1)->get_dof_indices(...);
  @endcode
  even if the cell corresponds to a one-dimensional triangulation where
  this was not previously possible.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/11)
  </p></li>

  <li>
  <p>New: After more than 2 years of work, we have merged a branch on which
  we have implemented the functionality necessary to distribute meshes on
  hundreds, thousands, or more processors. An overview of the framework
  in which this is implemented is presented in the @ref distributed module,
  the @ref distributed_paper, as well as in step-40.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Martin Kronbichler, Wolfgang Bangerth 2010/10/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>New: Documentation of how to handle constraints on degrees of freedom
  has been centralized in a new documentation module on @ref constraints.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: When using Trilinos and deal.II both with static libraries,
  a linker error would occur whenever a program linked both the 2d and
  3d libraries of deal.II. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: On all non-linux platforms, if static libraries were selected
  and <code>./configure</code> was instructed to use Trilinos (which also
  was compiled with static libraries), a failure would occur. This should
  now be fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/23)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: The step-33 tutorial program can not be built with GCC versions
  4.5.x. There are in fact two problems, one that pertains to uses of
  <code>std::make_pair</code> that don't work any more with the upcoming

  Trilinos version 10.4.0. While the latter problem can only be fixed in
  future Trilinos versions, at least the former problem is solved in step-33.

  building under CygWin.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/07/12)

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: GCC version 3.3.x failed to compile the files
  <code>lac/include/lac/precondition_block.h</code>,
  <code>deal.II/source/multigrid/mg_dof_handler.cc</code> and
  <code>examples/step-34/step-34.cc</code>. These problems have

  that checks that the compiler accepts the constructs in question. If the
  compiler does not, then these functions are disabled.

  target="_top">10591</a>, GCC versions prior to and including 4.1.x will
  still not work. Working with shared libraries was not and is not affected
  by this problem.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/01)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Updated: The version of <a href="http://www.boost.org/">boost</a>
   included in the <code>contrib/</code> directory has been updated
   to 1.43.0.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/06/30)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Fixed: GCC version 4.0.1 had a bug that prevented it from compiling
  release 6.3.0 because it apparently had an infinite loop allocating
  memory when compiling <code>fe_values.cc</code> in optimized mode. This
  problem had been fixed in GCC 4.0.2, but some versions of Mac OS X still use
  this GCC version in their Xcode environment. In any case, the code in
  deal.II has been changed to avoid this problem.
  <br>

  using shared libraries since the test ran in the wrong order with respect
  to another configure test. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Bradley Froehle 2010/06/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>Updated: The conversion tool in <code>contrib/mesh_conversion</code> that
  can read CUBIT output and convert it into something that is readable by
  deal.II has been updated.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret 2010/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: deal.II release 6.3.0 did not compile with Trilinos versions 9.x and
  10.0. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, WB 2010/06/28)

<ol>

<li> A static member function Point::unit_vector() has been introduced
to simplify the task of creating a vector in one coordinate direction
independent of the dimension.
<br>
(GK 2010/11/17)
</li>

<li><p> There are now Patterns::FileName and Patterns::DirectoryName classes
  that can be used to indicate that a given parameter is supposed to be
  a file or directory name.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann 2010/10/25)
  </p>

  <li><p> New: The ParameterHandler class is now built on the
  <a href="http://www.boost.org" target="_top">boost</a>
  <code>property_tree</code> library which provides a much better
  foundation for extensions. In particular, the description of parameters
  can now be exported in XML and JSON formats for processing with external
  programs, for example graphical user interfaces. As a consequence of
  the re-write, a bug in ParameterHandler::print_parameters_section
  was fixed when using the LaTeX output format.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/09)
  </p>

  <li><p> Fixed: The ParameterHandler::set() functions allowed to set values that
  did not satisfy the pattern given during declaration of the parameter. This
  is now fixed: the functions now throw an exception.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/09)
  </p>

  <li><p> Fixed: The Patterns::Integer and Patterns::Double classes did
  not properly check that a value given matched the pattern because they
  ignored text after an initial match. This led to <code>"3.141"</code> and
  <code>"3.141..,-RXYZ"</code> to be recognized as valid integers and
  double values, respectively. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/08)
  </p>

  <li><p> Fixed: The computation of quadrature points in the QGaussLobatto
  class uses a Newton method that was wrongly implemented. While the
  results were correct (at least for moderate orders), it required more
  iterations than necessary. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Andrea Bonito 2010/08/12)
  </p>

  <li><p> Changed: The DataOutBase::write_vtu function now writes data
  as 64-bit values, rather than 32-bit values.
  <br>
  (Scott Miller 2010/08/5)
  </p>

  <li><p> New: MappingQ and MappingQEulerian now support order > 1 also in
  codimension one. Step-34 has been modified to show how this works.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2010/07/23-27)
  </p>

  <li><p> New: QGaussOneOverR now has a new constructor for arbitrary quadrature
  points and not only the vertices of the reference cell.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai 2010/07/21)
  </p>
</ol>


<a name="lac"></a>
<h3>lac</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p>New: Added a new constructor for PETScWrappers::Vector that takes
  an existing PETSc Vec that was created by the user and is only wrapped for
  usage.
  <br>
  (TH, 2010/12/03)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: When Hypre is available as a sub-package of PETSc, the new class
  PETScWrappers::PreconditionBoomerAMG provides the BoomerAMG implementation
  of the algebraic multigrid method of the Hypre package as a preconditioner.
  This functionality is used, for example, in step-40.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister 2010/11/13)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: The class LAPACKFullMatrix now has functions to compute the
  singular value decomposition of a matrix and its inverse.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/11/7)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: The classes RelaxationBlockSOR and RelaxationBlockSSOR
  implement overlapping Schwarz relaxation methods. Additionally,
  their base class RelaxationBlock and the helper class BlockList have
  been added to the library.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/10/19)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Improved: The ConstraintMatrix::merge function now takes a second
  argument that indicates what should happen if the two objects to be
  merged have constraints on the very same degree of freedom.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/18)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Updated: Changes to the <code>SLEPcWrappers</code> to preserve
  compatibility with SLEPc version 3.1. Main new updated features are
  new solver classes: (i) Power; and (ii) Generalized Davidson.
  <br>
  (Toby D. Young 2010/08/04)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: SparseMatrix::precondition_SSOR and
  SparseMatrixEZ::precondition_SSOR had a bug, which made the SSOR
  method inaccurate for relaxation parameters different from unity.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/07/20)
  </p></li>
</ol>



<a name="deal.II"></a>
<h3>deal.II</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p>New: The GridTools::transform function used to work only on
  meshes that are not refined at all. It now also works on meshes
  that have been refined uniformly, though not on adaptively refined
  ones.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/12/20)
  </p></li>
  
  <li><p>New: When computing errors using
  VectorTools::integrate_difference in codimension one problems, if
  you specified a norm that requires the computation of the gradients,
  you would get in trouble, because on codimension one manifolds we only
  have information on the <em>tangential</em> gradient. This is now
  fixed, by discarding the normal component of the provided function,
  before computing the difference with the finite element function.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2010/12/05)
  </p></li>
  
  <li><p>New: The VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values function can now
  also be used to interpolate boundary values on meshes embedded in a higher
  dimensional space.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/20)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement misplaced
  the new central vertex of a quad in a two-dimensional mesh embedded into
  higher dimensional space if said quad was at the boundary of the surface
  described by this triangulation. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/18)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: The GridTools::extract_boundary_mesh function can be used to
  generate a surface mesh from the boundary of a volume mesh.
  <br>
  (Sebastian Pauletti, 2010/11/15)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: For DoF iterators, it was previously possible to write
  code like <code>*it1 = *it2</code>, presumably with the intent to
  copy the entire cell pointed to on the right hand side onto the cell
  pointed to at the left. However, this is not what happens since
  iterators are not pointers but only point to accessor classes. The
  assignment operator has therefore been removed.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/12)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: The GridOut::write_gnuplot function now also works for meshes
  that are embedded in a higher
  dimensional space (i.e. if the codimension was greater than 1).
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/03)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: The class hp::FEFaceValues and hp::FESubfaceValues were not
  previously available for meshes that were embedded in a higher
  dimensional space (i.e. if the codimension was greater than 1). This is
  now fixed. As a consequence, the VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values
  function is now also available for such meshes.
  <br>
  (WB, 2010/11/02)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: The FEValuesExtractors::Vector class did not work when the dimension
  of the domain was not equal to the dimension of the space in which it is
  embedded. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Sebastian Pauletti, WB, 2010/11/01)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Fixed: The methods VectorTools::project_boundary_values_curl_conforming
  set the boundary values now also H(curl)-conforming, when hanging node
  constraints are present.
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg, 2010/10/11)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Changed: The DataPostprocessor functions now take an additional
  argument that indicates the location of an evaluation point. For backward
  compatibility, the old function signature still exists so that applications
  that overload one of the existing functions continue to work.
  The old signature has been deprecated, however, and will be removed in a
  future version.
  <br>
  (Scott Miller 2010/10/08)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Changed: FETools is now a namespace rather than a class with only
  static member functions.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/09/25)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>New: FE_DGVector implements discontinuous elements based on
  vector valued polynomial spaces.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/09/17)
  </p></li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The methods VectorTools::interpolate_boundary_values and
  VectorTools::project_boundary_values with ConstraintMatrix argument added
  inhomogeneities also to DoFs that were already constrained when entering the
  call without changing the list of DoFs that those were constrained to. This
  leads to wrong results for inhomogeneous constraints in case e.g.
  DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints was called before. Now, the correct
  way for combining hanging node constraints and Dirichlet conditions in one
  ConstraintMatrix is to first make the hanging node constraints, and then
  interpolate/project the boundary values. The latter operation will then
  simply not add any new constraints if a DoF is already constrained. The
  same is also true for VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, Martin Kronbichler, WB 2010/09/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The method FEValuesViews::Vector::curl aborted the program in 2d under certain
  circumstances. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Andrea Bonito, WB 2010/09/14)
  </p>

  <li><p>Improved: MeshWorker::loop() now uses WorkStream for multithreading
  <br>
  (GK 2010/09/10)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The method FEValuesViews::SymmetricTensor< 2, dim, spacedim >::get_function_divergences
  incorrectly calculated the divergence.
  <br>
  (Andrew McBride 2010/09/09)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Reimplementation of the parent function in the various DoFCellAccessors so
  that one can call the parent function from a DoFIterator and also gets a
  DoFIterator returned.
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg 2010/08/30)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: FETools::compute_embedding_matrices now computes the embedding matrix
  for all refinement cases in parallel.
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg 2010/08/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: There is now a function CellAccessor::parent so that one can do
  <code>cell-@>parent()</code>
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg 2010/08/26)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Improved: DoFHandler has a default constructor, so that it can be used in containers.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/08/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: The functions VectorTools::project_boundary_values_curl_conforming
  are added. They can compute Dirichlet boundary conditions for Nedelec
  elements.
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg 2010/08/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The function FEValuesViews::Vector::get_function_curls produced
  wrong results in some cases, because it erased the given vector first.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Markus Buerg 2010/08/13)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  New: Ability to project second-order SymmetricTensor and first-order Tensor objects from the quadrature points to the support points of the cell using  FETools::compute_projection_from_quadrature_points
  <br>
  (Andrew McBride 2010/07/29)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: In some rather pathological cases, the function
  Triangulation::prepare_coarsening_and_refinement (which is called from
  Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement) could take very long
  if the flag Triangulation::eliminate_unrefined_islands was given in
  the mesh smoothing flags upon construction of the triangulation. This is
  now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/27)
  </p>

  <li><p> New: Brezzi-Douglas-Marini elements of arbitrary order in FE_BDM.
  <br>
  (GK 2010/07/19)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The FEValues::get_cell() function was unusable from user code
  since its implementation used a class that was only forward declared
  and not visible at the point of instantiations in user code. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/07/16)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>New: The multilevel matrices for continuous elements
  can be built with the MeshWorker now.
  <br>
  (B&auml;rbel Janssen 2010/07/01)
  </p></li>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: On some systems and compilers, the library could not be compiled
  because of a duplicate symbol in <code>MeshWorker::LocalResults</code>.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/06/28)
  </p>

  <li>
  <p>
  Fixed: The output of the function
  FE_Q::adjust_quad_dof_index_for_face_orientation
  was wrong in 3d for polynomial orders of three or greater. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (WB 2010/06/28)

 * @page changes_between_7_0_and_7_1 Changes between Version 7.0 and 7.1

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.
All entries are signed with the names of the author.
</p>


<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Changed: GridTools, DoFTools, MGTools, VectorTools, MatrixCreator
and MatrixTools are now namespaces. They have long
been classes that had only public, static member functions, making
the end result semantically exactly equivalent to a namespace, which is
also how it was used. This is now also reflected in the actual code.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/27, 2011/09/14)

<li> Changed: The PETScWrappers::VectorBase and PETScWrappers::MatrixBase
classes tried to keep track of
whether the last operation done on a vector was to add to an element or to
write into one. If the previous such operation was of a different kind
than the current one, we would flush buffers (see the description in
@ref GlossCompress). However, trying to do this automatically turned
out to be an endless source of hard-to-find bugs in %parallel programs.
The scheme has therefore now been changed to the following: the classes
keep track of the previous operation and if it differs from the
current one, reports an error stating that the user needs to call
PETScWrapper::VectorBase::compress() or
PETScWrapper::MatrixBase::compress() instead.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/03, 2011/08/30)

<li> Changed: The classes Tensor, SymmetricTensor and Point now have an
additional template argument for the number type. While a default template
value of <code>double</code> ensures that all old code is still valid, this
change invalidates forward declarations of the form <code>template
@<int dim@> class Point</code> that might be present in user-defined header
files. Now forward declarations need to specify the type as well, i.e.,
<code>template @<int dim, typename Number@> class Point</code>. However,
nothing changes if the full declarations in <code>deal.II/base/tensor.h,
deal.II/base/symmetric_tensor.h</code> and <code>deal.II/base/point.h</code>
are included.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2011/08/02)

<li> Removed: deal.II no longer supports Trilinos versions prior to 10.0.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/29)

<li> Changed: deal.II has a namespace std_cxx1x that was used to
import classes from BOOST that are part of the upcoming C++ 1x standard. On
the other hand, if your compiler supported a sufficiently large subset
of C++ 1x, we had code that simply did
@code
  namespace std_cxx1x = std;
@endcode
allowing you to refer to everything that was part of the compiler's namespace
<code>std</code> under the alternative name. This turned out to be untenable
in connection to the changed outlined below for _1, _2, etc. Consequently,
if the compiler used supports C++ 1x, we now selectively import elements of the
compiler's namespace std into namespace std_cxx1x as well. This may lead to
incompatibilities if you are already using elements of the C++ 1x
standard by referring to them through the std_cxx1x namespace and these elements
are not on the list of selectively imported ones.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/05/29)

<li> Changed: Previously, placeholder arguments like _1, _2, etc that are used
in conjunction with the std_cxx1x::bind function could be referenced as if
they are part of the global namespace. This was achieved by importing the
corresponding elements of namespace std::placeholders into the global namespace
if your compiler supported this part of the C++ 1x standard, or otherwise using
the BOOST counterparts which are already in the global namespace. However,
this leads to a conflict if one has a C++ 1x enabled compiler (e.g. GCC 4.6)
<i>and</i> includes certain BOOST headers, since the importation of symbols
into the global namespace now leads to ambiguous names. The only solution to
the problem is to not import names into the global namespace, but rather
import the names from either BOOST or namespace std into the deal.II namespace
std_cxx1x. The downside is that all code that uses _1, _2, etc needs to be
changed to use std_cxx1x::_1, std_cxx1x::_2, etc from now on.
<br>

<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>

<ol>
<li> New: Long in the making, the new tutorial program step-32 is a massively
%parallel simulator for the Boussinesq equations that describe thermal convection.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/06)

<li> New: There is now a namespace Utilities::MPI that holds some of the MPI-related
functions that were previously part of Utilities::System. Specifically, the following
functions were moved and in part renamed: Utilities::System::get_n_mpi_processes
is now Utilities::MPI::n_mpi_processes; Utilities::System::get_this_mpi_process
is now Utilities::MPI::this_mpi_process;
Utilities::System::compute_point_to_point_communication_pattern
is now Utilities::MPI::compute_point_to_point_communication_pattern;
Utilities::System::duplicate_communicator
is now Utilities::MPI::duplicate_communicator;
Utilities::System::calculate_collective_mpi_min_max_avg
is now Utilities::MPI::min_max_avg;
Utilities::System::MPI_InitFinalize
is now Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize.
In addition, some of the arguments of these functions or classes
have changed.
<br>
The previous functions should still be available, though their use
is now deprecated.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/26)

<li> Removed: Utilities::System::program_uses_mpi does exactly the same thing
as Utilities::System::job_supports_mpi. The former has therefore been
deprecated.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/26)

<li> New: When using a new enough version of GCC, debug sections in
object files are now compressed using the <code>-Wa,--compress-debug-sections</code>
flag, resulting in savings in disk space on the order of 230 MB.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/22)

<li> New: deal.II can now be configured and built with the
<a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang C++ frontend of the LLVM compiler</a>.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/20)

<li> Changed: Several of the tutorial programs used the same class
names, often <code>LaplaceProblem</code> in the earlier programs.
There is nothing inherently wrong with this, since these are
entirely separate programs, but this sometimes confused
integrated development environments because searching for
individual symbols would turn up several occurrences in different
files. To make this a bit simpler, the main classes for step-3
through step-6 were renamed to <code>StepX</code> (steps 1 and 2
do not have a main class). Starting with step-7, everything specific
to a tutorial program has been moved into a namespace called
<code>StepX</code> to make the fully qualified names unique across
different tutorial programs.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Guido Kanschat 2011/08/16)

<li> Extended: Many operations on objects of
type Point@<0@>, Quadrature@<0@>, etc
(including creation) were previously forbidden since such objects do not make
much sense. However, this prevented a lot of code that could otherwise work
in a dimension independent way, from working in 1d, e.g. integration on
faces. Many of these places have now been cleaned up and work.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/12)

<li> Extended: The classes Tensor, SymmetricTensor and Point now have an
additional template argument for the number type. It is now possible to base
these classes on any abstract data type that implements basic arithmetic
operations, like <code>Tensor<1,dim,std::complex<double> ></code>. deal.II
uses a default template argument <code>double</code> that ensures that all
code using e.g. <code>Tensor<1,dim></code> remains valid.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2011/08/02)

<li> Fixed: deal.II can link with Trilinos but previously it required a
very specific set of Trilinos sub-libraries; if Trilinos had been compiled
with a larger set of sub-libraries, linking would sometimes fail. This
has now been made more generic and deal.II obtains the proper set of
libraries from Trilinos.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/29)

<li> Fixed: On Mac OS X, linking with some external libraries such as Trilinos
sometimes failed due to a misconfiguration of linker flags. This should now be
fixed.
<br>
(Praveen C, Martin Kronbichler, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/23)

<li> Changed: Doing <code>make clean</code> was supposed to only remove object
files but not libraries; however, it also removed the TBB libraries and a
few executables. This has now been changed: <code>make clean</code> now only
removes stuff that isn't needed to run executables, i.e. it leaves the TBB
and other libraries alone. As before, the target <code>make distclean</code>
is responsible for removing everything.
<br>
(Max Jensen, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/14)

<li> New: The Triangulation and DoFHandler classes, together with many
smaller classes can now be serialized, i.e. their data can be written
to an output stream and later retrieved to restore the state of the program.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/13)

<li> New/deprecated: The Triangulation class offers ways to get informed
whenever the triangulation changes. Previously, the mechanism doing this
was through the Triangulation::RefinementListener class. This has been
deprecated and has been superceded by a BOOST signals based mechanism
that is generally more powerful and does not rely on overloading
particular virtual functions inherited from a base class.

While the old mechanism should continue to work, you should consider
upgrading. For more information on the signals mechanism, see the
documentation of the Triangulation class.

In addition to the change above, the new implementation now offers two
more signals one can subscribe to: Triangulation::Signals::clead for
when the triangulation is cleared, and Triangulation::Signals::any_change
that can be used for any operation that changes the mesh. Furthermore,
in a change from previous behavior, the Triangulations::Signal::create
signal is now also triggered when another triangulation is copied to
the one that owns the signal.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/06/01)

<li> Removed: The <code>./configure</code> script allowed configuring
for the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) in version 7.0 but didn't actually
use any of the GSL functions. The corresponding code has therefore been
removed again.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/05/22)

<li> Changed: Traditionally, include directories were set through the
<code>-I</code> flag in make files in such a way that one would do
@code
  #include <base/quadrature.h>
@endcode
In preparation for future changes that will make possible installing
header files in a directory under <code>/usr/include</code> it seemed
useful to install everything under <code>/usr/include/deal.II</code>
and include them as
@code
  #include <deal.II/base/quadrature.h>
@endcode
This change has been made throughout the library and tutorial programs.
However, the old way of using include directories will continue to work
for at least one release for backward compatibility.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/05/16)

<li> Changed: The version of BOOST we ship with deal.II has been upgraded
to 1.46.1. BOOST now also resides in the directory <code>contrib/boost-1.46.1</code>
instead of an unversioned directory.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/05/16)

<li> New: The SparseDirectUMFPACK class can now also deal with matrices
provided in SparseMatrixEZ format.
<br>
(Martin Genet, 2011/05/04)

<li> New: The new tutorial program step-46 shows how to couple different
models defined on subsets of
the domain, in this case Stokes flow around an elastic solid. The
trick here is that variables (here the flow velocity and pressure,
and the solid displacement) do not live on the entire domain, but
only on a part. The point of the program is how to represent this in
source code.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/30)

<li> Fixed: On Debian, the Trilinos packages use a different layout
of include files and library names. The <code>./configure</code>
script can now deal with this.
<br>
(Walter Landry, 2011/02/22)

<li> Improved: Linking the deal.II libraries on file systems that
are mounted remotely from a file server took painfully long. This
is now fixed by linking everything on the local file system
and only subsequently moving the file into its final location.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/28)

<li> Changed: Most classes in deal.II have a member function
<code>memory_consumption</code> that used to return an unsigned int.
However, on most 64-bit systems, unsigned int is still only 32-bit
wide, and consequently the return type does not provide enough
precision to return the size of very large objects. The return types
of all of these functions has been changed to std::size_t, which is
defined to be a type that can hold the sizes of all objects possible
on any system.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/22)

<li> Fixed: When using the <code>--enable-mpi</code> to
<code>./configure</code>, the script only tried <code>mpiCC</code>
as the MPI C++ compiler. However, on some systems, it is called
<code>mpicxx</code>. The script now tries that as well.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/22)

<li> Fixed: When using Trilinos and using the Intel C++ compiler,
we accidentally used invalid compiler flags that led to a warning
every time we compiled a file.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/22)

<li> Fixed: At the bottom of the page of tutorial programs we show a "plain"
version of the tutorial program. However, the script that generates this plain
version was broken and sometimes truncated the file. This
should be fixed now.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/18)

<li> Extended: Several missing instantiations of functions for triangulations
and DoF handlers embedded in higher dimensional space have been added.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/15)
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
<li> New: There is a new predicate IteratorFilters::LocallyOwnedCell
for filtered iterators.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/03)

<li> Improved: The class BlockList used in RelaxationBlock has been replaced
by SparsityPattern, since it only reproduced its functionality.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/09/26)

<li> New: SparsityPattern::row_position() finds a column index in a row and returns
its "local" index or numbers::invalid_unsigned_int.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/09/26)

<li> New: The functions Utilities::MPI::sum and Utilities::MPI::max
function can be used to compute the sum or maximum of values over a number of
MPI processes without having to deal with the underlying MPI functions.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/25)

<li> New: The CellAccessor::is_locally_owned function is a shortcut
for the <code>!cell-@>is_ghost() && !cell-@>is_artificial()</code> pattern
found in many places when dealing with distributed meshes.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/10)

<li> New: The GridGenerator::torus function and TorusBoundary class can
create and describe the surface of a torus.
<br>
(Daniel Castanon Quiroz, 2011/09/08)

<li> Fixed: FEFieldFunction class was not thread-safe because it keeps a
cache on the side that was invalidated when different
threads kept pouncing on it. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Patrick Sodr&eacute;, 2011/09/07)

<li> New: There is now a function GridTools::volume() computing the volume
of a triangulation.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/09/02)

<li> New: Code like <code>cell-@>face(1)-@>set_boundary_indicator(42);</code>
now also works in 1d.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/30)

<li> Fixed: The TimerOutput::print_summary() function changed the
precision of output on the stream it prints to, but didn't restore
the previous value. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/30)

<li> New: There are now two new functions Utilities::string_to_double.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/25)

<li> Changed: The function VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints
used to compute its constraints by evaluating the normal vector to the
surface as described by the mapping, rather than using the normal to
the surface described by the Boundary object associated with this face.
(Note that the Mapping computes its approximation by polynomial interpolation
of the surface described by the Boundary object.) This has now been changed:
the normal vector is now obtained from the Boundary object directly, at
points computed by the Mapping.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/25)

<li> New: The Boundary base class now has a function Boundary::normal_vector
that returns the normal vector to the surface at a given location. Derived
classes need to implement it, of course, if they want it to be used.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/25)

<li> Fixed: The function VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints had
a problem that led to extremely difficult to pin down bugs when running
with sufficiently many processors. Basically, the constraints computed
by different processors did not agree which should be the independent
degrees of freedom and which should be the constrained ones. The result
were constraints that did not lead to a consistent linear system.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2011/08/24)

<li> New: Added GridRefinement::hierarchical() to reorder the degrees of freedom
by going through the cells in hierarchical order. This ensures consistent
DoF numbering in parallel computations.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/08/24)

<li> Changed: Triangulation<dim>::get_boundary_indicators() returned
wrong data for dim=1.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti 2011/08/17)

<li> Improved: The function LogStream::timestamp() outputs all results of the Posix
function times, namely wall time, user time and system time.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/08/18)

<li> Extended: GridGenerator::half_hyper_shell() got the option
<code>colorize</code>, which assigns different boundary indicators to the
different parts of the boundary. Added GridGenerator::quarter_hyper_shell()
with the same options.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/08/15)

<li> Fixed: The functions VectorTools::create_boundary_right_hand_side()
called with an empty set of boundary_indicators (the default), did not apply
any boundary conditions. The empty set now applies it to all boundaries.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Sebastian Pauletti, 2011/08/15)

<li> Fixed: The function VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints had
a bug that led to an exception whenever we were computing constraints for
vector fields located on edges shared between two faces of a 3d cell if those
faces were not perpendicular. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Thomas Geenen, Timo Heister, 2011/08/10)

<li> New: The function FullMatrix::triple_product() adds triple products
like Schur complements to existing matrices.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/08/05)

<li> Improved: The PETScWrapper::VectorBase class was rather generous in
calling the PETSc <code>VecAssembleBegin/End</code> functions that incur
communication in the %parallel case and are therefore causes of potential
slowdowns. This has been improved.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/08/03)

<li> Fixed: The function VectorTools::create_right_hand_side now also works
for objects of type hp::DoFHandler with different finite elements.
<br>
(Daniel Gerecht, 2011/07/20)

<li> Improved: Evaluation of Lagrangian basis functions has been made stable
by exchanging polynomial evaluation from the standard form
$a_n x^n+\ldots+a_1 x + a_0$ to a product of linear factors,
$c (x - x_0) (x-x_1)\ldots (x-x_n)$. This ensures accurate evaluation up to
very high order and avoids inaccuracies when using high order finite elements.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler 2011/07/26)

<li> Improved: The internal functions in the constructor of the FE_Q element
have been improved for high order elements. Especially when the element is
constructed for a 1D quadrature formula, the initialization is now much faster.
E.g. the initialization up to order 12 in three dimension completes in less
than a second, whereas it took hundreds of seconds before.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler 2011/07/26)

<li> New: There is now a class Threads::ThreadLocalStorage that allows threads
to have their own copy of an object without having to fear interference from
other threads in accessing this object.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/07)

<li> Fixed: The 2d grid reordering algorithm that is used by all grid readers had
a component that was quadratic in its complexity, sometimes leading to cases
where reading in a mesh in debug mode could take minutes for just a few tens
of thousands of cells. This has now been fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/07)

<li> New: The function DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component now also works
for objects of type hp::DoFHandler.
<br>
(Christian Goll, Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/06)

<li> Fixed: Under some circumstances, Threads::Thread::join() could only be
called once and would generate a system exception when called a second time.
Since it is often useful to not track whether this function had already been
called, this is now worked around in such a way that one can always call
the function multiple times.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/03)

<li> New: The Threads::Thread::join() function can now also be called even
if no thread has been assigned to this thread object. The function then simply
does nothing.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/03)

<li> New: There is now a new function Threads::Thread::valid that can be used
to query whether the thread object has been assigned a thread.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/07/01)

<li> New: The new function GridGenerator::merge_triangulations can be used to compose
coarse meshes from simpler ones by merging their cells into a single
triangulation object.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/06/17)

<li> Fixed: If an FEValues object was kept around until after the triangulation
on which it works has been refined or coarsened, and is then reinitialized
with a cell from the refined triangulation, it could compute wrong results or
crash outright. This has now been fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/06/02)

<li> Changed: The TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern::trilinos_sparsity_pattern()
function returned a reference to an object of kind Epetra_CrsMatrix. However, the
actual object pointed to is of derived class Epetra_FECrsMatrix. The function
has now been changed to return a reference to the latter type. Since derived
references can be assigned to references to base, this change should not
result in any incompatibilities.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/05/27)

<li> New: The class RelaxationBlockJacobi has been added to the relaxation classes.
<br> (Guido Kanschat, 2011/05/19)

<li> New: discontinuous Galerkin versions of vector-valued elements have been
implemented: FE_DGBDM, FE_DGNedelec, and FE_DGRaviartThomas.
<br> (Guido Kanschat, 2011/05/19)

<li> New: Mapping<dim,spacedim>::transform_real_to_unit_cell  now
works also in the codimension one case, where it performs the normal
projection of the point on the codimension one surface.
<br> (Luca Heltai, 2011/05/17)

<li> New: The PersistentTriangulation class now works also in
the codimension one case.
<br>
(Luca Heltai, 2011/05/16)

<li> Fixed: The TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::print() function
didn't get column indices right. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Habib Talavatifard, Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/05/10)

<li> Fixed: The TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::operator() and
TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::el() functions sometimes produced
wrong results for rectangular matrices. The same is true for
TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern::exists(). This is now fixed.
<br>
(Habib Talavatifard, Wolfgang Bangerth 2011/05/09, 2011/05/27)

<li> New: The version of DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern that takes
the coupling masks is now also available for hp::DoFHandler objects.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/27)

<li> Fixed: If Triangulation::create_triangulation is called after an
hp::DoFHandler object is attached to the triangulation object, setting active
FE indices leads to a crash. The problem did not happen if the mesh was
refined before setting the FE indices. This is now fixed. In the process, the
Triangulation::RefinementListener::create_notification function was
introduced.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/22)

<li> Fixed: The function FEValuesViews::SymmetricTensor::divergence had a bug.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Feifei Cheng, Venkat Vallala 2011/04/21)

<li> Fixed: Under some conditions, FEFaceValues applied to an FESystem element
that contained elements of type FE_Nothing would receive an erroneous
exception. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/17)

<li> New: There is now an operator* for the multiplication of a <code>SymmetricTensor@<2,dim@></code>
and a <code>Tensor@<1,dim@></code>.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/12)

<li> Fixed: Added some instantiations to make KellyErrorEstimator and SolutionTransfer
work in  codimension one. Fixed some dim in spacedim.
<br>
(Luca Heltai, 2011/04/11)

<li> Fixed: Added some instantiations to make anisotropic refinement work
in codimension one.
<br>
(Luca Heltai, 2011/03/31)

<li> Fixed: Corrections in the creation of the face and subface
interpolation matrices in the class FE_Nedelec.
<br>
(Markus B&uuml;rg, 2011/03/17)

<li> Fixed: In step-21, the inner iteration would sometimes not converge for
very coarse meshes because of numerical roundoff. This is now fixed by allowing
more than <code>rhs.size()</code> CG iterations if the number of degrees of freedom
is very small.
<br>
(Jichao Yin, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/04/06)

<li> New: There is now a new function ConditionalOStream::get_stream().
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/03/09)

<li> Fixed: FESystem::get_unit_face_support_points would refuse to return
anything if one of the base elements did not have support points. This
condition has been relaxed: it now only doesn't return anything if this
base element has no support points and also has degrees of freedom on
the face.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/03/07)

<li> Fixed: Objects of type FE_Nothing could be generated with multiple vector components
by passing an argument to the constructor. Yet, the FE_Nothing::get_name() function
always just returned the string <code>FE_Nothing@<dim@>()</code> independently of the
number of components. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/03/07)

<li> Fixed: PETScWrappers:MPI:SparseMatrix and apply_boundary_values() produced an error in debug mode about non-existant SparsityPattern entries. Reason: clear_rows() also eliminated the whole row in the PETSc-internal SparsityPattern, which resulted in an error in the next assembly process.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/02/23)

<li> Fixed: It wasn't possible to use the FE_Nothing element inside an FESystem
object and hand the result over to an FEValues object. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/18)

<li> New: There is now a function DataOutBase::write_visit_record that does
the equivalent for VisIt that DataOutBase::write_pvtu_record does for ParaView:
generate a file that contains a list of all other VTK or VTU files of which the
current parallel simulation consists.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/16)

<li> New: There is now a function TrilinosWrappers::VectorBase::minimal_value.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/16)

<li> Fixed: TableBase::operator= could not be compiled if the type of the
elements of the table was <code>bool</code>. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/16)

<li> Improved: The GridGenerator::hyper_shell function generated meshes in 3d
that are valid but of poor quality upon refinement. There is now an additional
option to generate a coarse mesh of 96 cells that has a much better quality.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/12)

<li> Fixed: There are systems where the <code>libz</code> library is installed
but the <code>zlib.h</code> header file is not available. Since the latter
condition was not tested, this would result in compiler errors. This is now
fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/09)

<li> Fixed: Prolongation and restriction matrices were not computed at all
for elements of type FE_DGQ if <code>dim@<spacedim</code>. Consequently,
consumers of this information, such as the SolutionTransfer class or
the DoFCellAccess::set_dof_values_by_interpolation function did not
work either and simply returned zero results. This is now fixed.
<br>
(M. Sebastian Pauletti, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/09)

<li> Fixed: When refining a mesh with codimension one, edges were refined using
the same manifold description as adjacent cells, but this ignored that a
boundary indicator might have been purposefully set for edges that are truly at
the boundary of the mesh. For such edges, the boundary indicator is now honored.
<br>
(M. Sebastian Pauletti, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/09)

<li> Fixed: The functions VectorTools::compute_mean_value and
VectorTools::integrate_difference now also work for distributed
triangulations of type parallel::distributed::Triangulation.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/02/07)

<li> Changed: If the <code>libz</code> library was detected during library
configuration, the function DataOutBase::write_vtu now writes data in compressed
format, saving a good fraction of disk space (80-90% for big output files).
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/28)

<li> New: Trilinos and PETSc vectors now have a function has_ghost_elements().
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/01/26)

<li> Changed: The TrilinosWrappers::MPI::BlockVector::compress function now takes an
argument (with a default value) in exactly the same way as the
TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector::compress function already did.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/21)

<li> Fixed: When calling DataOut::build_patches with a mapping, requesting more
than one subdivision, and when <code>dim@<spacedim</code>, then some cells
were not properly mapped. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/01/18)

<li> New: Restructured the internals of <code>PETScWrappers::Precondition*</code>
to allow a PETSc PC object to exist without a solver. New: Use
<code>Precondition*::%vmult()</code> to apply the preconditioner once.
Preconditioners now have a default constructor and an <code>initialize()</code>
function and are no longer initialized in the solver call,
but in the constructor or <code>initialize()</code>.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/01/17)

<li> Fixed: Boundary conditions in the step-23 tutorial program are now
applied correctly. Matrix columns get eliminated with the used method
and introduce some contribution to the right hand side coming from
inhomogeneous boundary values. The old implementation did not reset the
matrix columns before applying new boundary values.
<br>
(Martin Stoll, Martin Kronbichler, 2011/01/14)

<li> Extended: <code>base/tensor.h</code> has an additional collection of
contractions between three tensors (<i>ie</i>. <code>contract3</code>).
This can be useful for writing matrix/vector assembly in a more compact
form than before.
<br>
(Toby D. Young, 2011/01/12)

 * @page changes_between_7_1_and_7_2 Changes between Version 7.1 and 7.2

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.
All entries are signed with the names of the author.
</p>



<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
<li> Changed/fixed: Several operations on Trilinos vectors that change the
elements of these vectors were allowed accidentally for vectors that have
ghost elements. This is a source of errors because a change on one
MPI process will not show up on a different processor. Consequently, we
intended to disallow all functions that modify vectors with ghost elements
but this was not enforced for all of these functions. This is now fixed
but it may lead to errors if your code relied on the existing behavior. The
way to work around this is to only ever modify fully distributed vectors,
and then copy it into a vector with ghost elements.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/08/06)

<li> Changed: The argument material_id of the estimate-functions of
the KellyErrorEstimator class is now of type types::material_id
with default value numbers::invalid_material_id, instead of type
unsigned int with default value numbers::invalid_unsigned_int. This
should not make a difference to most users unless you specified the
argument's default value by hand.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Christian Goll 2012/02/27)

<li>
The member functions Triangulation::set_boundary and
Triangulation::get_boundary now take a types::boundary_id instead of
an unsigned int as argument. This now matches the actual data type
used to store boundary indicators internally.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Christian Goll 2012/02/27)
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
<li>
New: We now support parallel output using HDF5/xdmf.
<br>
(Eric Heien, Timo Heister, 2012/08/28)

<li>
New: We are now compatible with Trilinos 10.4.2, 10.8.5, and 10.12.2. See the
readme for more information.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/08/24)

<li>
Changed: To make the naming of types defined in namespace types
consistent, we have renamed types::subdomain_id_t to
types::subdomain_id. The old name has been retained as a typedef
but is now deprecated.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/08/22)

<li>
Changed: Unify the concept of compress() for all linear algebra
objects. Introduce type VectorOperation to decide between
add and insert. Implement also for serial vectors. Note:
this breaks distributed::vector::compress(bool). See
@ref GlossCompress for more information.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/08/13)

<li>
Changed: Support for the METIS 4.x has been replaced with support for
METIS 5.x. Use <code>--with-metis=path/to/metis</code> to configure
with METIS 5.x.
<br>
(Stefano Zampini, Toby D. Young 2012/08/13)

<li>
Changed: numerics/vectors.h is now called numerics/vector_tools.h and
numerics/matrices.h is now called numerics/matrix_tools.h The old files are
deprecated.
<br>
(Timo Heister 2012/08/09)

<li>
New: officially added support for clang 3.1 or newer.
<br>
(Timo Heister and Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/08/07)

<li>
Changed: PETSc linking now prefers to use the libpetsc.so generated
by PETSc starting from version 3.1+. This fixes the problem
of linker errors on recent gcc/ubuntu versions.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/08/07)

<li>
Fixed: On some 64-bit systems, we build deal.II with the <code>-m64</code>
flag but forgot to build UMFPACK with this flag as well, leading to
linker errors. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/07/31)

Fixed: The Intel compiler, when using MPI, wants that <code>mpi.h</code>
is included before header files like <code>stdio.h</code>. This can't
be ensured in general because the inclusion might be indirectly, but
we now work around the problem in other ways.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, Michael Thomadakis, 2012/07/26)

<li>
Fixed: On some systems, the p4est library we use for distributed
parallel computations installs its libraries into a <code>lib64/</code>
directory instead of the usual <code>lib/</code>. deal.II can now deal
with this.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/07/25)

<li>
New: step-43 is an extension of step-21 that shows efficient methods
to solve multi-phase flow.
<br>
(Chih-Che Chueh, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/06/06)

<li>
New: step-15 has been replaced by a program that demonstrates the
solution of nonlinear problem (the minimal surface equation) using
Newton's method.
<br>
(Sven Wetterauer, 2012/06/03)

<li>
New: step-48 demonstrates the solution of a nonlinear wave equation
with an explicit time stepping method. The usage of Gauss-Lobatto
elements gives diagonal mass matrices, which obviates the solution of
linear systems of equations. The nonlinear right hand side is
evaluated with the matrix-free framework.
<br>
(Katharina Kormann and Martin Kronbichler, 2012/05/05)

<li>
New: step-37 shows how the matrix-free framework can be utilized to
efficiently solve the Poisson equation without building global
matrices. It combines fast operator evaluation with a multigrid solver
based on polynomial Chebyshev smoother.
<br>
(Katharina Kormann and Martin Kronbichler, 2012/05/05)

<li>
New: A new matrix-free interface has been implemented. The framework
is parallelized with MPI, TBB, and explicit vectorization instructions
(new data type VectorizedArray). The class MatrixFree caches
cell-based data in an efficient way. Common operations can be
implemented using the FEEvaluation class.
<br>
(Katharina Kormann and Martin Kronbichler, 2012/05/05)

<li>
New: step-44 demonstrates one approach to modeling large
deformations of nearly-incompressible elastic solids. The
elastic response is governed by a non-linear, hyperelastic
free-energy function. The geometrical response is also
nonlinear, i.e., the program considers finite deformations.
<br>
(Andrew McBride and Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2012/04/25)

<li>
New: step-41 demonstrates solving the obstacle problem,
a variational inequality.
<br>
(Joerg Frohne, 2012/04/22)

<li>
Changed: The version of BOOST we ship with deal.II has been upgraded
to 1.49.0.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2012/04/07)

<li>
New: We have added a brief section to the step-12 tutorial programs that
compares the DG solution computed there with one that one would obtain by
using a continuous finite element.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/03/25)

<li>
New: Added support for codimension 2, i.e. for dim-dimensional objects
embedded into spacedim=dim+2 dimensional space.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti, 2012/03/02)

<li> Changed: Material and Boundary indicators have been both of the
type unsigned char. Throughout the library, we changed their datatype
to <code>types::material_id</code>
resp. <code>types::boundary_id</code>, both typedefs of unsigned
char. Internal faces are now characterized by
numbers::internal_face_boundary_id(<code>=static_cast@<types::boundary_id@>(-1)</code>)
instead of 255, so we get rid of that mysterious number in the source
code.  Material_ids are also assumed to lie in the range from 0 to
numbers::invalid_material_id-1 (where <code>numbers::invalid_material_id =
static_cast<types::material_id>(-1)</code>). With this change, it is now
much easier to extend the range of boundary or material ids, if
needed.
<br>
(Christian Goll 2012/02/27)

<li> New: Functions like FEValues::get_function_values have long been
able to extract values from pretty much any vector kind given to it (e.g.
of kind Vector, BlockVector, PETScWrappers::Vector, etc). The list of
allowed "vector" types now also includes IndexSet, which is interpreted
as a vector of elements that are either zero or one, depending on whether
an index is in the IndexSet or not.
<br>
As a consequence of this, the DataOut::add_data_vector functions now also
work for such types of vectors, a use demonstrated in step-41.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/14)

<li> New: It has long been a nuisance that the deal.II vector classes
could only be accessed using <code>operator()</code> whereas the C++
<code>std::vector</code> class required <code>operator[]</code>. This
diminished the usefulness of template code. Historically, the reason
was that the deal.II vector classes should use the same operator as
the matrix classes, and C++ does not allow to use <code>operator[]</code>
for matrices since this operator can only take a single argument.
<br>
In any case, all deal.II vector classes now support both kinds of
access operators interchangeably.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/12)

<li> Fixed: Linking shared libraries on PowerPC systems (e.g. on
BlueGene systems) failed due to a miscommunication between compiler
and linker. This is now worked around.
<br>
(Aron Ahmedia, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/06)

<li> New: There is now a distributed deal.II vector class
parallel::distributed::Vector that can be used with MPI. The
vector is based on a contiguous locally owned range and allows easy
access of ghost entries from other processors. The vector interface is
very similar to the non-distributed class Vector<Number>.
<br>
(Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler, 2012/01/25)

<li> Fixed: The <code>common/scripts/make_dependencies</code> program
now behaves like the C++ compiler when
searching include paths for <code># include "..."</code> directives.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/01/10)

<li> Fixed: The Intel compiler complains that it can't copy Trilinos vector
reference objects, preventing the compiling of step-32. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/09)

<li> Fixed: Intel ICC 12.1 gets into trouble with BOOST because BOOST
believes that the compiler supports C++0x but one then still has to
specify the corresponding flag on the command line to avoid compiler
errors. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/06)

<li> Fixed: On some systems, <code>mpiCC</code> turns out to alias the
C compiler, not the C++ compiler as expected. Consequently, try to use
<code>mpic++</code> or <code>mpicxx</code> before <code>mpiCC</code> as
these should really be unambiguous.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/05)

<li> Fixed: Intel's ICC compiler identifies itself as <code>icpc version
12.1.0 (gcc version 4.2.1 compatibility)</code> which we mistook as being
GCC version 4.2. The same is true for the Intel C compiler. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/05)

<li> Fixed: deal.II could not be compiled with gcc 4.6.1 when MPI is
enabled due to a missing include file in file
<code>source/base/utilities.cc</code>. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/25)
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
<li> Changed: To support Trilinos version 10.12.x we need to cache the
result of has_ghost_elements() in parallel vectors at construction time
of the vector. Starting from 10.12 Trilinos will communicate in this
call, which therefore only works if called from all CPUs.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/08/22)

<li> New: The copy constructor of FullMatrix from IdentityMatrix
used to be explicit, but that didn't appear to be necessary in hindsight.
Consequently, it is now a regular copy constructor.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/08/14)

<li> New: The Patterns::Map pattern allows to describe maps from keys
to values in input files.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/08/01)

<li> Fixed: DoFTools::make_zero_boundary_constraints now also works for parallel distributed triangulations.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/07/24)

<li> Fixed: GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point() works now also if the cell in which the point we look for lies is not adjacent to the closest vertex of p. The tests bits/find_cell_8 and _9 illustrate this.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Christian Goll 2012/07/20)

<li> Fixed: Using the SolutionTransfer class with hp::DoFHandler
and on meshes where some cells are associated with a FE_Nothing element
could result in an error. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/06/29)

<li> Fixed: The MappingQ1::transform_real_to_unit_cell function as
well as the equivalent ones in derived classes sometimes get into
trouble if they are asked to compute the preimage of this point
in reference cell coordinates. This is because for points outside
the reference cell, the mapping from unit to real cell is not
necessarily invertible, and consequently the Newton iteration to
find the preimage did not always converge, leading to an exception.
While this is not entirely wrong (we could, after all, not compute
the desired quantity), not all callers of this function were prepared
to accept this result -- in particular, the function
CellAccessor<3>::point_inside should have really just returned false
in such cases but instead let the exception so generated propagate
through. This should now be fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Eric Heien, Sebastian Pauletti, 2012/06/27)

<li> Fixed: The function VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints had
a bug that led to an exception whenever we were computing constraints for
vector fields located on edges shared between two faces of a 3d cell if those
faces were not parallel to the axes of the coordinate system. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Jennifer Worthen, 2012/06/27)

<li>
Fixed: Due to an apparent bug in autoconf, it was not possible to
override the <code>F77</code> environment variable to select anything
else than gfortran. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/06/08)

<li> Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::VectorBase::swap() is now working as expected. (thanks Uwe K&ouml;cher)
<br>
(Timo Heister 2012/07/03)

<li> Fixed: Some instantiations for
DerivativeApproximation::approximate_derivative_tensor() were missing.
<br>
(Timo Heister 2012/06/07)

<li> New: The finite element type FE_DGQArbitraryNodes is now
working also in codimension one spaces.
<br>
(Luca Heltai, Andrea Mola 2012/06/06)

<li> Fixed: Computing the $W^{1,\infty}$ norm and seminorm in
VectorTools::integrate_difference was not implemented. This is now
fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2012/06/02)

<li> Fixed: A problem in MappingQ::transform_real_to_unit_cell
that sometimes led the algorithm in this function to abort.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth 2012/05/30)

<li> New: The function DataOutInterface::write_pvd_record can be used
to provide Paraview with metadata that describes which time in a
simulation a particular output file corresponds to.
<br>
(Marco Engelhard 2012/05/30)

<li> Fixed: A bug in 3d with hanging nodes in GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex()
that caused find_active_cell_around_point() to fail in those cases.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth 2012/05/30)

<li> New: DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints implemented which
inserts algebraic constraints due to periodic boundary conditions
into a ConstraintMatrix.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2012/05/22)

<li> New: The GridIn::read_unv function can now read meshes generated
by the Salome framework, see http://www.salome-platform.org/ .
<br>
(Valentin Zingan, 2012/04/27)

<li> New: There is now a second DoFTools::map_dofs_to_support_points
function that also works for parallel::distributed::Triangulation
triangulations.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/04/26)

<li> New: There is now a second DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs
function that also works for parallel::distributed::Triangulation
triangulations.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/04/26)

<li> New: The FullMatrix::extract_submatrix_from, FullMatrix::scatter_matrix_to,
FullMatrix::set functions are new.
<br>
(Andrew McBride, Jean Paul Pelteret, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/04/24)

<li> Fixed:
The method FEValues<dim>::inverse_jacobian() previously returned the transpose of the
inverse Jacobians instead of just the inverse Jacobian as documented. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti, Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler, 2012/03/11)

<li> Extended:
SolutionTransfer is now also able to transfer solutions between hp::DoFHandler where
the finite element index changes during refinement.
<br>
(Katharina Kormann, Martin Kronbichler, 2012/03/10)

<li> Changed:
A new method to determine an initial guess for the Newton method was coded
in MappingQ::transform_real_to_unit_cell.
The code in transform_real_to_unit_cell was cleaned a little bit and a new code
for the @<2,3@> case was added.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti, 2012/03/02)

<li> Changed:
In the context of codim@>0, Mapping::transform would require different inputs
depending on the mapping type.
For mapping_covariant, mapping_contravariant the input is DerivativeForm<1, dim, spacedim>
but for mapping_covariant_gradient,  mapping_contravariant_gradient the input is Tensor<2,dim>.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti,  2012/03/02)

<li> New:
A new class DerivativeForm was added.
This class is supposed to represent the derivatives of a mapping.
<br>
(Sebastian Pauletti, 2012/03/02)

<li> Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::Vector::all_zero() in parallel.
<br>
(Timo Heister, J&ouml;rg Frohne, 2012/03/06)

<li> New: GridGenerator::quarter_hyper_shell() in 3d.
<br>
(Thomas Geenen, 2012/03/05)

<li> New: DataOut::write_vtu_in_parallel(). This routine uses MPI I/O to write
a big vtu file in parallel.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/02/29)

<li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::clear() forgot
to update the number cache of this class, leading to wrong results
when calling functions like
parallel::distributed::Triangulation::n_global_active_cells();
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/20)

<li> Improved: FEFieldFunction allows now for the computation of Laplacians.
<br>
(Christian Goll, 2012/02/16)

<li> New: The function IndexSet::fill_binary_vector creates a numerical
representation of an IndexSet containing zeros and ones.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/12)

<li> New: The function IndexSet::clear resets an index set to be empty.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/12)

<li> New: There are now global functions l1_norm() and linfty_norm() that compute
the respective norms of a rank-2 tensor.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/02/08)

<li> New: VectorTools::interpolate_to_different_mesh implemented which interpolates between
     DoFHandlers with different triangulations based on a common coarse grid.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2012/02/08)

<li> Improved: DoFTools::map_dofs_to_support_points() now also works within the hp framework.
<br>
(Christian Goll, 2012/02/02)

<li> Improved: There is now a constructor for FESystem that allows to
create collections of finite elements of arbitrary length.
<br>
(Jason Sheldon, 2012/01/27)

<li> Improved: VectorTools::point_value() now also works within the hp framework.
<br>
(Christian Goll, 2012/01/26)

<li> Fixed: GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point() for the hp-case works now also with MappingCollections containing only one mapping, as is the standard case in other functions using hp.
<br>
(Christian Goll, 2012/01/26)

<li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction()
contained a rounding bug that often produced wrong results.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/01/24)

<li> Improved: Utilities::break_text_into_lines now also splits the string at '\\n'.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/01/17)

<li> Fixed: When <code>./configure</code> does not detect the presence
of <code>zlib</code>, writing output in VTU format failed to produce
a valid output file.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/01/03)

<li> Improved: <code>PETScWrappers::SolverXXX</code> class was
restricted to using default solver options for the KSP only. It is now
possible to override those by using PETSc command-line options
<code>-ksp_*</code>; giving greater flexibility in controlling PETSc
solvers. (See the class's documentation).
<br>
(Vijay S. Mahadevan, 2011/12/22)

<li> New: The GridIn class now also reads the GMSH format 2.2 as written by
GMSH 2.5.
<br>
(Vijay S. Mahadevan, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/12/19)

<li> Improved: The GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_optimize function
assumed that the expected convergence order was 2. It has now gotten an
argument by which the user can prescribe a different value. A bug has also
been fixed in which the function incorrectly assumed in its algorithm that
the mesh was two-dimensional.
<br>
(Christian Goll, 2011/12/16)

<li> Fixed: Restriction and prolongation didn't work for elements of
kind FE_Nothing. Consequently, many other parts of the library also
didn't work, such as the SolutionTransfer class. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/12/15)

<li> Fixed: The DerivativeApproximation class now works for distributed computations.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/12/15)

<li> Changed: The ExcMessage exception class took an argument of
type <code>char*</code> that was displayed when the exception
was raised. However, character pointers are awkward to work with
because (i) they can not easily be composed to contain things like
file names that are only known at run-time, and (ii) the string
pointed to by the pointer had to live longer than the local expression
in which the exception is generated when using the AssertThrow macro
(because, when we create an exception, the exception object is passed
up the call stack until we find a catch-clause; at that time, however,
the scope in which the exception object was created has long been left).
This restriction made it impossible to construct the message using std::string
and then just do something like <code>(std::string("file: ")+filename).c_str()</code>.
<br>
To remedy this flaw, the type of the argument to ExcMessage has been
changed to std::string since objects of this type are readily copyable
and therefore live long enough.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/12/14)

<li> New: Setting up a class derived from DataPostprocessor required some
pretty mechanical steps in which one has to overload four member functions.
For common cases where a postprocessor only computes a single scalar or
a single vector, this is tedious and unnecessary. For these cases, the
new classes DataPostprocessorScalar and DataPostprocessorVector provide
short cuts that make life simpler.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/12/14)

<li> Changed: The DataPostprocessor class previously required users of this
class to overload DataPostprocessor::get_names(),
DataPostprocessor::get_data_component_interpretation()
and DataPostprocessor::n_output_variables(). The latter function is redundant
since its output must equal the length of the arrays returned by the
first two of these functions. It has therefore been removed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/12/14)

<li> Improved: Objects of the type LogStream::Prefix can now be used
as a safe implementation of the push and pop mechanism for log
prefices.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/12/09)

<li> New: IndexSet::add_indices(IndexSet).
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/12/09)

<li> Fixed: Finite element Hessians get computed for codimension one,
at least for FE_Poly derived classes.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2011/12/07)

<li> Changed: Output of ParameterHandler::print_parameters with argument
ParameterHandler::LaTeX was not particularly readable. The output has
therefore been rewritten to be more structured and readable.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/28)

<li> Fixed: The TimerOutput class set the alignment of output to right-aligned
under some circumstances, but didn't reset this to the previous value at the
end of output. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/28)

<li> New: The copy constructor of the SparseMatrixEZ function now works
(rather than throwing an exception) if the copied matrix has size zero.
This is in accordance to the other matrix classes.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/15)

<li> New: The class ScalarFunctionFromFunctionObject provides a quick way to
convert an arbitrary function into a function object that can be passed
to part of the library that require the Function@<dim@> interface.
The VectorFunctionFromScalarFunctionObject class does a similar thing.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/11/15)

<li> New: The DoFTools::count_dofs_per_block function now also works
for objects of type hp::DoFHandler.
<br>
(Jason Sheldon, 2011/11/13)

<li> New: FETools::get_fe_from_name() can now return objects of type FE_Nothing.
<br>
(Scott Miller, Jonathan Pitt, 2011/11/10)

<li> New: Implementation of an alternative handling of
inhomogeneous constraints in ConstraintMatrix. This is controlled with
a new parameter use_inhomogeneities_for_rhs in
distribute_local_to_global() and determines whether the correct or
zero values (this was the case before and still is the default) are
kept in the linear system during the solution process.
<br>
(J&ouml;rg Frohne, 2011/11/01)

<li> Fixed: SparseMatrix::mmult and SpareMatrix::Tmmult had a number of
issues that are now fixed: (i) rebuilding the sparsity pattern was allowed
even if several of the matrices involved in these operations shared a
sparsity pattern; (ii) the functions had a vector argument that had a default
value but the default value could not be used because it wasn't used in a
template context deducible by the compiler.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/30)

<li> New:
parallel::distributed::Triangulation::mesh_reconstruction_after_repartitioning
setting which is necessary for save()/load() to be deterministic. Otherwise
the matrix assembly is done in a different order depending on the order of old
refinements.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/10/26)

<li> New: TriaAccessor<>::minimum_vertex_distance().
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/10/25)

<li> New: TableHandler::print_text now supports not only printing column
keys above their own column, but also in a separate header, to make it simpler
for external plotting programs to skip this line.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/22)

<li> Fixed: Trying to write a TableHandler object that is empty resulted
in a segmentation fault. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/21)

<li> New: The TableHandler class can now pad columns that have only been
partially filled. See the documentation of the class for a description.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/18)

<li> Fixed: In TableHandler::print_text, it can happen that the function
wants to print an empty string as the element of the table to be printed.
This can confuse machine readers of this table, for example for visualization,
since they then do not see this column in that row. To prevent this, we now
print <code>""</code> in such places.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/18)

<li> Fixed: Using Trilinos versions 10.4 and later on Debian failed to
configure due to a different naming scheme of Trilinos libraries on
Debian. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/17)

<li> Changed: The TableHandler class has been changed significantly
internally.  It could previously store arbitrary values (though in practice,
only int, unsigned int, double and std::string were implemented). The class is
now restricted to this particular set of types. On the other hand, the
TableHandler class can now be serialized.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/17)

<li> Fixed: searching in the doxygen documentation.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/10/13)

<li> New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::save()/load() to store
the refinement information to disk. Also supports saving solution vectors
using the SolutionTransfer class.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2011/10/12)

<li> Fixed: The DataOut_DoFData::merge_patches did not compile with newer compilers.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2011/10/11)

</p>



<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

<li> Changed: There are various changes to PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector
to minimize usage errors and to make the behavior similar to Trilinos:
objects with ghost elements are now read-only, the function
update_ghost_values() is no longer required (but called automatically
if needed). This requires some changes in user code.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/16)

<li>Changed: Over the past few years, deal.II has accumulated a
number of things that we would like to change but that would introduce
incompatibility. Examples are inconsistent naming of functions or types,
or things put into the wrong namespace. In reality, while there are
about 100 examples of things we'd like to get rid of, most of them are
rather obscure to begin with and will not affect most user code.
Nevertheless, as a developer community, we are
very careful in making such incompatible changes.

All this said, it is sometimes necessary. We plan to create an incompatible
release 8.0 at a later time. To give users a chance to already see which
functions need to be changed, we have introduced markers into the deal.II
header files that identify which functions, classes or symbols are now
deprecated. If your compiler supports this, it will then warn if you are
using any of these. The documentation for each of these symbols discusses
the recommended alternative, which are in all cases already in place. In
other words, you can already change your code in such a way that it compiles
both with the current 7.3 release as well as with the future 8.0 release
in which these symbols will have been removed.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/1/5)

<li>Changed: deal.II previously had two separate classes, DoFHandler
and MGDoFHandler, for standard and multilevel discretizations, respectively.
There were also corresponding accessor hierarchies for the cell and
face iterators. This turned out to be an obstacle for future developments.
Consequently, the functionality of the MGDoFHandler class has been merged
into the standard DoFHandler (which already was a base class of MGDoFHandler;
moving the functions down in the class hierarchy therefore does not
significantly affect how these classes are used). The MGDoFHandler class
still exists for now, but is deprecated and will be removed in deal.II 8.0.
Use the DoFHandler class instead which has obtained all the functionality of
the old MGDoFHandler class.

From a user perspective, there is only one significant change: The old
MGDoFHandler::distribute_dofs() function called DoFHandler::distribute_dofs()
and then distributed degrees of freedom on all levels of the multilevel
hierarchy. In the new scheme, this is now achieved using the function
DoFHandler::distribute_mg_dofs(). In other words, where you previously
used the class MGDoFHandler and called MGDoFHandler::distribute_dofs(), you
should now use the class DoFHandler and call first DoFHandler::distribute_dofs()
and then DoFHandler::distribute_mg_dofs().
<br>
(Markus B&uuml;rg, Timo Heister, Guido Kanschat, 2013/01/03)

<li>Removed: The Triangulation and DoFHandler classes had a great number
of functions that allowed to get the first and last iterators to cells,
faces, lines, quads and hexes overall and on each level of the mesh
hierarchy individually. While conceptually a nice idea to offer such a
rich set of functions, there are two factors that led us to drastically
reduce this set of functions: (i) A large interface makes it more
difficult to fully document what every function is doing and more
difficult to find what one is looking for. (ii) A large interface
makes it incredibly difficult to evolve the data structures on which
these functions operate. We felt that the many functions we have impeded
our ability to make changes to the internal storage of data. A survey
of the deal.II code base as well as some larger applications also shows
that most of these functions are rarely used, if at all.
<br>
Consequently, most of these functions have been removed. The only functions
that remain are the following (for each of the Triangulation and the
various DoFHandler classes):
<pre>
<code>
    cell_iterator        begin       (const unsigned int level = 0) const;
    active_cell_iterator begin_active(const unsigned int level = 0) const;
    cell_iterator        end         () const;
    cell_iterator        end         (const unsigned int level) const;
    active_cell_iterator end_active  (const unsigned int level) const;
</code>
</pre>
<br>
Codes that have previously used functions like <code>begin_active_line</code>
etc. to loop over the lines or quads of a triangulation need to be changed
to loop over cells, and on each cell loop over the lines or quads of this
cell. In most cases we have encountered (in deal.II or its testsuite) this
was a rather trivial modification. A case to watch out for is that the
old loop over all lines encountered all lines only once whereas one may
encounter it multiple times when looping over all cells and then the lines
of each cell. This case is easily avoided by flagging each treated line
using the @ref GlossUserFlags "user flags" associated with lines, quads,
and cells.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/22)

<li>New: In the past, deal.II used a std::vector of bools in many places
to denote component masks (see @ref GlossComponentMask) as well as for
block masks (see @ref GlossBlockMask). This was neither
descriptive (the data type does not indicate what it is supposed to
represent, nor whether the proper size for such an argument would be equal
to the number of degrees of freedom per cell, the number of vector components
of the finite element, or the number of degrees of freedom in total).
<br>
There are now new class types ComponentMask and BlockMask that are used in these places.
They are used both descriptively (as a return type of the function
FiniteElement::get_nonzero_components indicating the vector components within
which a given shape function is nonzero) as well as prescriptively (as
input arguments to functions such as those listed in the glossary entry
linked to above).
<br>
While the descriptive places are not backward compatible (they return a
ComponentMask which is not convertible to the std::vector of bools returned
before), most of the prescriptive places are in fact backward compatible
(because the std::vector of bool that was passed previously can
implicitly be converted to an object of type ComponentMask. The sole
exception is the function DoFTools::extract_dofs (and its multigrid
equivalent DoFTools::extract_level_dofs) that previously
could interpret its argument as either a component or
a block mask, depending on a boolean flag. This function now exists
in two different versions, one that takes a ComponentMask and
one that takes a BlockMask. Call sites need to be adjusted.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/22)

<li> Removed: the optional argument offset got removed from
DoFHandler and MGDoFHandler::distribute_dofs() because it was
never working correctly and it is not used.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/03)
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>

<li> Changed: parallel sparse matrices now also require the use of
compress(VectorOperation) like vectors do. See the glossary for details.
Old functions are now deprecated.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/25)

<li> New: step-49 demonstrates advanced techniques for mesh creation and
manipulation.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/19)

<li> Fixed: Many places in the documentation have been made to consistently
use doxygen markup that indicates that this is code, so that doxygen will
cross-link the piece of code to class and function names. Many typos have also
been fixed.
<br>
(Felix Gruber, 2013/02/15)

<li> Fixed: Starting in release 7.1, we first built the deal.II shared libraries
in the local <code>/tmp</code> or similar directory rather than the final location
because linking becomes very slow over remotely mounted file systems. Unfortunately,
this schemes turns out not to work under Cygwin on Windows systems: executables
cannot link with libraries that have been moved/renamed after linking. If we are
running on Cygwin, we therefore revert to the old scheme.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/02/11)

<li> New: finite element FE_Q_DG0 that implements polynomials
of order k with an additional discontinuous constant function.
<br>
(Daniel Arndt, Timo Heister, 2013/01/07)

<li> step-6 now uses ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global()
instead of condense(), which is the preferred way to use a ConstraintMatrix
 (and the only sensible way in parallel).
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/11/02)

<li> Simplifications of the internal structures of Triangulation and
DoFHandler, in particular removal of specializations.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2012/09/13)
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
<li> Fixed: The ArpackSolver interface to the ARPACK eigenvalue solver could
not be compiled with newer C++ compilers. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Juan Carlos Araujo Cabarcas, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/02/20)

<li> New: PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockVector now has a constructor and reinit
that takes a std::vector<IndexSet> (same interface as in Trilinos).
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/19)

<li> New: PETScWrappers::*Matrix::%add(other, factor) to
add a scaled other matrix to the current matrix.
<br>
(Jose Javier Munoz Criollo, 2013/02/19)

<li> New: GridGenerator::extrude_triangulation() allows
you to extrude a 2d mesh to turn it into a 3d mesh.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/16)

<li> PETScWrappers::Vector::operator= and PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector::operator=
now call update_ghost_values()
automatically if necessary. This means that update_ghost_values()
does not need to be called from user code at all any more.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/02/14)

<li> Fixed: VectorTools::interpolate did not work properly in 1d if
boundary indicators had been set to anything but the default (i.e.,
zero at the left and one at the right end of the domain). This was
a hold-over from the past when these were the only possible values.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Kevin Dugan, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/02/14)

<li> Improved: The iterator class of the deal.II SparseMatrix class
and SparsityPattern have been revised for performance. Iterating over
a row of the matrix and querying the column index and the value is now
similarly fast as iterating over a vector.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/02/12)

<li> New: A new overload of BlockMatrixBase::add allows to add one block
matrix to another, with a scaling factor.
<br>
(Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2013/02/05)

<li> Fixed: The FEValues machinery silently accepted the case when the
mapped cell (or the cell geometry) were distorted. An assertion has been
added to the computation of the Jacobian determinants for the volume
element that aborts whenever the Jacobian determinant in a quadrature
point becomes too small or negative.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/01/18)

<li> Improved: SLEPcWrappers:: The interface to SLEPc has an improved
handle on SolverControl and solver data can now be extracted at run
time. An example usage has been added to step-36.
<br>
(Toby D. Young, 2013/01/18)

<li> Fixed: Various variants of the TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::reinit
functions take a parameter <code>drop_tolerance</code> that allows to remove
small values from the matrix and replace them by zero instead. This was not
enforced for values on the diagonal of the matrix but only for off-diagonal
ones. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/01/17)

<li> New: All vector classes should now have a in_local_range()
function indicating whether a given index is locally stored or not.
<br>
(Daniel Arndt, 2013/01/14)

<li> Fixed: The one-argument version of ConstraintMatrix::condense was
not prepared to deal with parallel vectors. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Daniel Arndt, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/1/9)

<li> New: Utilities::int_to_string can now deal with any 32-bit
integer, not just those with up to 6 digits.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/1/5)

<li> New: The PETScWrappers::MatrixBase::write_ascii() now takes a
(defaulted) argument allowing to select the PETSc Viewer style.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/1/2)

<li> New: The PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector::print() function overloads the
function of same name in the base class to ensure that the output
generated by a parallel vector makes sense.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/1/2)

<li> New: The PETScWrappers::VectorBase class now has a function
PETScWrappers::VectorBase::write_ascii() that allows writing the
vector's data to the default output stream.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/1/2)

<li> Fixed: PETScWrappers::SparseDirectMUMPS forgot to release
its memory upon destruction. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Alexander Grayver, 2012/12/12)

<li> Fixed: Using the copy constructor of FESystem led to trouble
down the road because some pointers were freed by the copy while
still in use by the original object. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/12/03)

<li> Improved: GridTools::make_periodicity_constraints substantially:
The low level interface now allows to specify a face orientation that
will be used when matching and constraining DoFs for periodic boundary
conditions. With that, the high level interface will work correctly on
(mainly 3d) grids that have cells in non standard orientation.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2012/12/01)

<li> Fixed: Fix GeometryInfo<2>::child_cell_on_face to respect face_flip
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2012/12/01)

<li> New: There is now a version of DoFTools::make_zero_boundary_constraints()
that accepts a boundary indicator as argument.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/11/25)

<li> Fixed: The DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern() function
had a bug that triggered in 1d whenever there were neighboring
cells that differed in refinement level by more than one. This
is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/11/20)

<li> Improved: The inner product, norm, and mean value computation
of deal.II's own Vector class are now parallelized by threads.
The parallelization does not change the order in which the additions
take place, ensuring exact reproducibility from one run to the next.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2012/11/18)

<li> New: The TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBase class now has
a function TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBase::Tvmult that
allows applying the transpose preconditioner.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2012/11/04)

<li> New: The parallel::distributed::Triangulation::n_global_levels()
function returns the maximal refinement level over all involved
processors.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/11/04)

<li> New: In addition to the regular subdomain ids (see
@ref GlossSubdomainId) there is now a second set of flags called
"level subdomain ids" that also assigns a subdomain to every cell
in a multigrid hierarchy.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/11/04)

<li> Changed: GridOut::write_xfig has been improved in a number
of ways. In particular, one can now color cells based on a number
of different criteria that can be set in GridOutFlags::XFig.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2012/11/04)

<li> The class Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize now also initializes
PETSc, when PETSc is installed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/11/02)

<li> Fixed: DoFTools::make_flux_sparsity_pattern wasn't prepared to
deal with adaptively refined meshes in 1d.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/10/30)

<li> New: Added PETScWrappers::PreconditionParaSails and
PETScWrappers::PreconditionNone. PETScWrappers::PreconditionParaSails
implements the interface to use the ParaSails sparse approximate
inverse preconditioner from the HYPRE suite. ParaSails supports
parallel distributed computations and can handle nonsymmetric
and also indefinite problems. PETScWrappers::PreconditionNone
implements non-preconditioning in PETSc which can be of use
together with the PETScWrappers::MatrixFree class.
<br>
(Martin Steigemann, 2012/10/26)

<li> New: The PETScWrappers::SparseDirectMUMPS class now allows to
exploit symmetry of the matrix, using the
PETScWrappers::SparseDirectMUMPS::set_symmetric_mode() function.
<br>
(Alexander Grayver, 2012/10/23)

<li> Fixed: Several static const member variables of the Accessor
classes were not properly instantiated. This only rarely created
trouble because they are typically only used as template arguments
and the compiler substituted them. However, one would get linker
errors when passing around a reference to them. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Guido Kanschat, 2012/10/11)

<li> Fixed: Handle lucky breakdowns in GMRES/FGMRES.
<br>
(B&auml;rbel Janssen, Timo Heister, 2012/10/09)

<li> Fixed: GridTools::find_cells_adjacent_to_vertex got into
trouble with anisotropically refined meshes. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Abner Salgado, Tobias Leicht, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/10/08)

<li> Fixed: FESystem can now deal with n_elements==0 for a block.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/28)

<li> Fixed: ParameterHandler::print_parameters, when using
ParameterHandler::OutputStyle::LaTeX would always print a list
of parameters in each section as a latex itemized environment.
However, if there are none, we end up with an empty list which
latex does not like. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/27)

<li> New: Added SparsityTools::distribute_sparsity_pattern() for
BlockCompressedSimpleSparsityPattern. This allows parallel computations
with distributed::Triangulation and PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockSparseMatrix.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/25)

<li> New: Added BlockCompressedSimpleSparsityPattern::column_number().
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/25)

<li> New: There is now a function hp::FECollection::n_blocks() in analogy to
the existing function hp::FECollection::n_components().
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/20)

<li> Changed: step-8 now outputs data in VTK format, rather than GMV.
GMV has long been dead.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/19)

<li> Fixed: One can compile deal.II with MPI support but run programs
that aren't intended to use parallel communications and that, in fact,
do not call <code>MPI_Init</code> at all. They are nevertheless supposed
to work but previously the TimerOutput would crash under these conditions.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/18)

<li> Fixed: If you pipe content into the deallog object and there
is no end-line or flush after this content, and if a file stream
is associated to this object, and if that happens at the end of
the lifetime of the program, then the program would crash.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/17)

<li> Fixed: The use of TableHandler::set_precision affected not only the
precision with which elements of a table were printed, but also the
precision carried by the output stream after writing the table was
finished. It thus affected the precision
with which later output was produced. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/16)

<li> Fixed: Output of super-columns in TableHandler::write_text()
was inconsistent. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/16)

<li> Changed: Due to incompatibilties with some hdf5 packages installed from
repositories we disable auto-detection of hdf5. Use --with-hdf if you need it.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/14)

<li> New MeshWorker::LocalIntegrator and integration_loop() provide a
less confusing interface to MeshWorker loops.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2012/09/13)

<li> New: TableHandler TextOutputFormat::simple_table_with_separate_column_description
that skips aligning the columns for increased performance.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2012/09/10)

<li> Fixed: The Clang C++ compiler had some trouble dealing with obtaining
the return value of a Threads::Task object, due to a compiler bug in
dealing with friend declarations. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/04)

<li> Fixed: When applying a ConstraintMatrix to a block matrix
where the last few rows are empty, we ran into an unrelated assertion.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Jason Sheldon, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2012/09/04)

 * @page changes_between_7_3_and_8_0 Changes between Version 7.3 and 8.0

<p>
This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.
All entries are signed with the names of the authors.
</p>



<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

<li> Removed: it was possible to call get_dof_indices(), get_dof_values(),
set_dof_values(), and distribute_local_to_global() for cells that were not
active, if the finite element only had DoFs on vertices (i.e. Q1). This is
no longer allowed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/06/02)

<li> Changed: Internal structures of ExceptionBase are now thread safe. The
Assert macro does not print an exception to deallog any more prior to
throwing if deal_II_exceptions::abort_on_exception==false. Removed: A
number of obsolete Exceptions that are not used in the library any more.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/16)

<li> Removed: A number of header files that have been deprecated a long time
ago have been removed. All of them had previously only included the header file
that had superseded them. To upgrade, simply include the currently used
header file. This is also backward compatible with deal.II 7.3.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2013/04/12)

<li> Removed: The interfaces to the obsolete direct solvers MA27 and MA47 from
the Harwell Subroutine Library. Support for the HSL routines were not ported to
the new build system. However, the sparse direct solver UMFPACK remains to be
supported and is provided as part of the standard deal.II distribution, unlike
the HSL functions.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/01)

<li> Changed: The TimeDependent::end_sweep function with an argument indicating
the number of threads has been removed. Use the corresponding function without
an argument. Since the argument had a default value, few users will have used
this function.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/03/17)

</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> Improvements on the CMake build system: A Working C (or Fortran) compiler
  is now fully optional; Improved support for static linkage with a toggle
  "DEAL_II_PREFER_STATIC_LIBS" that will prefer static archives for non system
  libraries and "DEAL_II_STATIC_EXECUTABLE" that will switch the complete link
  interface to static linkage.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/07/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: various functions for parallel computations got introduced to
  make Trilinos and PETSc interfaces similar. Now step-40 can be used with
  PETSc or Trilinos with just a few changes. This patch also introduces
  better support for block systems in the PETSc interfaces.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/07/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: deal.II can now be compiled to 64-bit global dof indices. To turn
  this feature on, use the cmake option -DDEAL_II_WITH_64BIT_INDICES=ON. If
  PETSc and/or Trilinos are used, they must be compiled to support 64-bit
  indices. To write a code that can use 32-bit and 64-bit indices depending on
  deal.II compilation option, use types::global_dof_index for all the global
  dof indices.
  <br>
  (Kainan Wang and Bruno Turcksin, 2013/06/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: All vector classes now have a member function
  <code>locally_owned_elements</code> that returns an index
  set indicating which elements of this vector the current
  processor owns.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/24)
  </li>


  <li> New: A new element FE_Q_iso_Q1 has been implemented that is defined by
  a subdivision of the element into smaller Q1 elements. An element of order
  @p p is similar to FE_Q of degree @p p with the same numbering of degrees of
  freedom. The element is useful e.g. for defining a sparser preconditioner
  matrix for AMG at higher order FE_Q elements or for representing a component
  of a system of PDEs where higher resolution is preferred over high order.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: The step-49 tutorial program now also has a discussion on
  what to do once you have a coarse mesh and want to refine it.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: The number of threads used by deal.II/TBB can now be limited at
  run time. Using MPI based code using PETSc/Trilinos no longer requires you
  to compile the library without threads. See MPI_InitFinalize and
  MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit for details.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/03/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: The results section of step-36 now explains how to use ARPACK
  as an alternative to SLEPc as eigenvalue solver.
  <br>
  (Juan Carlos Araujo Cabarcas, 2013/03/25)
  </li>

  <li> New: deal.II now uses <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>
  as its configuration and build tool. Please read through the
  readme and other installation files for information about how the
  installation process has changed.
  <br>
  Because this touches the configuration of every external package we
  interact with, there are a number of other changes as a result:
  <ul>
    <li>The minimum supported version for Trilinos is now 10.8.x.
    <li>We no longer link with different versions of the p4est library
        in debug and optimized mode. Rather, we now link with the same
	library in both modes. The p4est installation instructions have
	been updated.
  </ul>
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/03/07)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>

<li>New: VectorTools::project and a whole host of similar functions
are now also available for objects of type hp::DoFHandler.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/21)
</li>

<li>Fixed: hp::DoFHandler::n_boundary_dofs() had a bug that always led
to a failed assertion. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/21)
</li>

<li>Fixed: VectorTools::project has an option to first project onto the
boundary. However, the implementation of this option ignored the mapping
that is provided to the function. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/16)
</li>

<li>Improved: The WorkStream class used throughout deal.II is now using
thread local variables and initializes temporary variables on the thread
that uses them, leading to better cache locality.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/16)
</li>

<li>Improved: The "pure" functions in MeshWorker::LocalIntegrator are now implemented and throw
an exception if not overloaded.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2013/07/16)
</li>

<li> New: The function SparseDirectUMFPACK::Tvmult is now implemented.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/07/03)
</li>

<li> New: In addition to the FEValuesExtractors::Scalar,
FEValuesExtractors::Vector, and FEValuesExtractors::SymmetricTensor classes,
there are now also fully featured FEValuesExtractors::Tensor extractors
for non-symmetric tensors of rank 2.
<br>
(Denis Davydov, 2013/07/02)
</li>

<li> New: There are now functions Tensor::component_to_unrolled_index()
and Tensor::unrolled_to_component_indices() in the same way as they
already exist for the SymmetricTensor class.
<br>
(Denis Davydov, 2013/07/02)
</li>

<li> New: There is now a read-write version of TableIndices::operator[].
<br>
(Denis Davydov, 2013/07/02)
</li>

<li> New: The function parallel::distributed::Triangulation::copy_triangulation() is
now implemented.
<br>
(Martin Steigemann, 2013/07/02)
</li>

<li> New: TriaRawIterator::operator < (TriaRawIterator&) now implements a total ordering
relation for cells even on distributed::parallel::Triangulation across processors.
Additionally, TriaRawAccessor and CellAccessor now have an ordering relation.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2013/06/24)
</li>

<li> New: CellAccessor::id() that returns a unique CellId that
also works in parallel computations (where level and index is not
useful).
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/06/24)
</li>

<li> New: added ConstantTensorFunction<rank, dim> and ZeroTensorFunction<rank, dim> to provide
a tensor valued analogue to ConstantFunction and ZeroFunction.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/06/20)
</li>

<li> Fixed: BlockSparsityPattern::column_number was returning
wrong values.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/06/16)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The stabilization parameter for the artificial diffusion
in the step-31 tutorial program has been increased slightly to avoid
instabilities at later times (<i>t</i> > 60).
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/06/04)
</li>

<li> Fixed: If an exception was generated on a task created by
Threads::new_task, the program would terminate with a segmentation
fault, leaving little trace of what had happened. This is now handled
more gracefully.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/06/02)
</li>

<li> Changed: subdomain ids can now only be queried/set on active cells.
Consequently, is_artificial(), is_ghost(), and is_locally_owned() is
now restricted to active cells.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/05/31)
</li>

<li> Improved: Triangulation::begin(level) and Triangulation::end(level) now return an
empty iterator range if the level is larger than the maximal locally owned level,
but still in the global level range of a distributed Triangulation.
<br>
(Timo Heister and Guido Kanschat, 2013/05/26)
</li>

<li> New: The IndexSet::add_indices function that takes another IndexSet
object now has an additional argument <code>offset</code> that can be used
to offset the indices of first argument.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/25)
</li>

<li> New: ConstraintMatrix::distribute is now also implemented for
arguments of type PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockVector.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/25)
</li>

<li> Fixed: IndexSet::operator== returned the wrong results
in some cases.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/25)
</li>

<li> New: The global function <code>complete_index_set()</code>
creates and returns an index set of given size that contains
every single index with this range.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/24)
</li>

<li> New: All vector classes now have a static member variable
<code>supports_distributed_data</code> that indicates whether the
vector class supports data that is distributed across multiple
processors. This variable is provided as a <i>traits variable</i>
to allow generic algorithms working on general vector types to
query the capabilities of the vector class at compile time.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/23)
</li>

<li> Fixed: FETools::back_interpolate has been revised to work correctly
also with parallel::distributed::Vector.
<br>
(Martin Steigemann, 2013/05/23)
</li>

<li> Removed: The file <code>mesh_worker/vector_info.h</code> was unused and
untested. It has thus been removed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Guido Kanschat, 2013/05/21)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The method parallel::distributed::Vector::compress
(VectorOperation::insert) previously set the elements of ghost elements
unconditionally on the owning processor, even if they had not been touched.
This led to a problem in certain library functions where vector entries became
zero in a spurious way. This is now fixed by discarding the elements in ghost
entries for the VectorOperation::insert operation. This is legitimate since we
assume consistency of set elements across processors, so the owning processor
sets the element already.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/21)
</li>

<li> Improved: DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints now also works
for meshes where the refinement level of the two sides of the domain
is not the same, i.e., one side is more refined than the other.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/20)
</li>

<li> Improved: Through the fields DataOutBase::VtkFlags::time and
DataOutBase::VtkFlags::cycle, it is now possible to encode the time and/or
cycle within a nonlinear or other iteration in VTK and VTU files written
via DataOutBase::write_vtk and DataOutBase::write_vtu.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/12)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The method ConvergenceTable::evaluate_convergence_rates with
 reference column did not take the dimension of the reference column into
 account, leading to wrong logarithmic rates for dim!=2. This can now be fixed
 by specifying the dimension as a last argument.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/10)
</li>

<li> Improved: The functions MatrixTools::create_mass_matrix and
MatrixTools::create_laplace_matrix take now an optional ConstraintMatrix
argument that allows to directly apply the constraints. This also helps
VectorTools::project. Note that not providing constraints remains the default
and recommended way to ensure consistency when several matrices are combined.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/08)
</li>

<li> New: The classes TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix and
TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix now fully implement vmult and Tvmult with
deal.II's own vector classes Vector<double> and
parallel::distributed::Vector<double>.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/08)
</li>

<li> Improved: The matrix-vector product ChunkSparseMatrix::vmult now runs in
parallel in shared memory.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/07)
</li>

<li> New: The class ChunkSparseMatrix and the associated
ChunkSparsityPattern now offer iterator classes to iterate over rows of the
matrix in an STL-like way.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/07)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The stopping criterion for early exit in SolverBicgstab did not
work properly for systems with large values, leading to premature exit. This
is now fixed.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/07)
</li>

<li> Changed: The SolverGMRES implementation previously applied two
iterations of the modified Gram&ndash;Schmidt algorithm for
orthogonalization. In many situations one iteration is enough. The algorithm
can now detect loss of orthogonality and enables re-orthogonalization only if
necessary. The second iteration (and, hence, old behavior) can be forced by
the flag SolverGMRES::AdditionalData::force_re_orthogonalization.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/05/06)
</li>

<li> Changed: FETools::interpolate is now instantiated for all
vector types, not just dealii::Vector and dealii::BlockVector.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/05/06)
</li>

<li> Fixed: setting values in TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix
in parallel was adding the values instead.
<br>
(Bruno Turcksin, Timo Heister, 2013/05/03)
</li>

<li> Fixed: Generate an error if the user tries to refine a cell
that is already on the maximum level in a distributed triangulation.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/05/01)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The version of ParameterHandler::set that takes a boolean
as second argument was broken and did not work. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Ashkan Dorostkar, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/30)
</li>

<li> Fixed: PETScWrappers::VectorBase::print now saves and restores
the precision
and width associated with the stream it prints to around setting
the values passed as arguments.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/04/22)
</li>

<li> Fixed: FullMatrix::print now saves and restores the precision
and width associated with the stream it prints to around setting
the values passed as arguments.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/04/22)
</li>

<li> New: LogStream now has member functions LogStream::width,
LogStream::precision and LogStream::flags that make it look more
like normal objects of type <code>std::ostream</code>.
<br>
(Fahad Alrashed, 2013/04/22)
</li>

<li> New: SparseDirectUMFPACK has long had the ability to work with
BlockSparseMatrix objects, but couldn't deal with BlockVector objects.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/21)
</li>

<li> New: Class TimerOutput::Scope does automatic scope based enter/
exit_section of a TimerOutput object.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/04/18)
</li>

<li> Fixed: TimerOutput constructed with an MPI_COMM in wall_time
mode now constructs synchronized Timer objects. This gives reliable
parallel benchmark timings.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/04/18)
</li>

<li> Improved and Fixed: LogStream (and deallog) now respect std::flush in
addition to std::endl to write out content to the console/file.
Furthermore, LogStream::push(...) and LogStream::pop() now work in a thread
safe manner. Also allow to pop() the prefix "DEAL".
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/18)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The HalfHyperShellBoundary class got refining
the edges that sit at the perimeter of the circular face of the domain
wrong. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, J&ouml;rg Frohne, 2013/04/17)
</li>

<li> New: Functions::FEFieldFunction can now deal with
parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/15)
</li>

<li> New: There is now a version of SparseMatrix::copy_from that can copy
from TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, J&ouml;rg Frohne, 2013/04/15)
</li>

<li> Improved: The SolverCG implementation now uses only three auxiliary
vectors, down from previously four. Also, there are some shortcuts in case
PreconditionIdentity is used that improve the solver's performance.
<br>
(Martin Kronbichler, 2013/04/11)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The results section of step-23 did not show the movie in release 7.3
due to a poor HTML markup. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/10)
</li>

<li> Fixed: It is now possible to use the MeshWorker framework in 1d as well.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Scott Miller, 2013/04/09)
</li>

<li> Fixed: It was not possible to create a default-constructed object of
type Triangulation<1>::face_iterator. This is now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, Scott Miller, 2013/04/09)
</li>

<li> New: VectorTools::subtract_mean_value can now be called without a
boolean mask. The vector type is templatified and instantiated for all
non distributed vectors.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/08)
</li>

<li> Fixed: It is now possible to call ConvergenceTable::evaluate_convergence_rates
multiple times.
<br>
(Matthias Maier, 2013/04/08)
</li>

<li> Fixed: GridTools::distort_random (previously called Triangulation::distort_random)
had a bug where points were only ever moved in <i>positive</i> coordinate
directions rather than with uniform probability in either direction. The 1d
implementation also had the problem that it did not move vertices if the
<i>cell</i> they were on was at the boundary, even if the <i>vertex</i>
itself was not. All of these problems are now fixed.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/04/05)
</li>

<li> New: There is a class VectorFunctionFromTensorFunction that converts
between objects of type TensorFunction and Function.
<br>
(Spencer Patty, 2013/4/2)
</li>

<li> Fixed: The ParameterHandler class could not deal with parameters named
<code>"value"</code> (and a few other names). This is now fixed.
<br>
(Denis Davydov, Matthias Maier, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/3/31)
</li>

<li> Changed: TimerOutput no longer assumes that sections are not nested
when outputting percentage and total run time.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/3/28)
</li>

<li> New: MPI_InitFinalize can also initialize PETSc/Slepc when
not compiling with MPI. This is now the preferred way to initialize
MPI/PETSc/Slepc in all cases.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/3/26)
</li>

<li> Added/fixed: IterativeInverse::vmult() can now handle vectors
using a different number type than the matrix type. As usual, the
number types must be compatible. Addtitionally, the initial guess is
always set to zero, since starting with the incoming vector makes no
sense.
<br>
(Guido Kanschat, 2013/03/21)
</li>

<li> Added GridOut::write_svg() to allow for the output of
two-dimensional triangulations in two space dimensions in the SVG
format (Scalable Vector Graphics, an generic XML-based vector image
format developed and maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C).
This function also provides cell coloring and cell labeling for the
visualization of basic cell properties. Pespective view is further
possible and the cell level number may be converted into altitude,
revealing the inactive cells lying below.
<br>
(Christian Wlker, 2013/03/21)
</li>

<li> Added TimerOutput::reset to remove the collected information so far and
added a new frequency TimerOutput::never to only output information if
triggered by print_summary().
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/03/20)
</li>

<li> Changed: FEValuesExtractors::Scalar, FEValuesExtractors::Vector and
FEValuesExtractors::SymmetricTensor could not be default constructed, and
consequently one could not easily put them into arrays (where they would
be default constructed when changing the size, and later assigned useful
values). These classes can now be default constructed to invalid
values, but can of course not be used in any useful way.
<br>
(Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/03/15)
</li>

<li> Fixed: FETools::interpolation_difference did not work with PETSc.
This is now fixed.
<br>
(Timo Heister, 2013/03/01)
</li>

This is the list of changes made between the deal.II releases listed above.
All entries are signed with the names of the author.
</p>



<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Changed: During the implementation of the 64-bit features for deal.II
  8.0, many linear algebra classes obtained a local typedef
  <code>size_type</code> indicating the integer type that is used to index
  into them. In some instances, this was accidentally set to
  <code>types::global_dof_index</code> (which may be a 64-bit data type)
  even in cases where this is clearly not going to work, for example for
  FullMatrix::size_type, since we will not be able to store full matrix
  objects of sizes for which a 32-bit index type is not sufficient. In
  these cases, the typedef was reverted to just <code>unsigned int</code>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/04)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: With the switch of the testsuite to CMake, the old report_features
  and build test facilities are removed.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/12/03)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: The kinds of template arguments for the VectorTools::interpolate
  function taking a Mapping as first argument has changed. This was done to
  work around a bug in the Intel ICC compiler which led to linker errors. Since
  the actual function argument list remains unchanged, the only way you will
  notice this change is if you <i>explicitly</i> specify template arguments.
  The only place one would typically do that is if you take the address of
  a template function. Since this is not a common operation, the impact of this
  change is probably limited.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/11/27)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: The ghost handling of the parallel::distributed::Vector class has
  been reworked: The vector now carries a global state that stores whether
  ghost elements have been updated or not. If a vector has ghost elements, it
  does not allow calls to compress() any more. Instead, a compress operation
  can now only be done when the ghost entries have been cleared before by
  calling zero_out_ghosts() or operator=0. The state can be queried by the new
  method has_ghost_elements(). This change avoids spurious entries to be
  inserted with compress(), but requires some change in user codes. The
  behavior of a ghosted vector is now very similar to ghosted PETSc and
  Trilinos vectors. The only difference is that the <i>same</i> vector can
  also be used as a non-ghosted vector which is designed for use in assembly
  routines.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/10/18)
  </li>

  <li>
  Removed: GridTools::collect_periodic_face_pairs. This function is superseded
  by GridTools::collect_periodic_faces which exports an
  std::vector<PeriodicFacepair<...>> instead.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/09/30)
  </li>

  <li>
  Removed: The member function face_to_equivalent_cell_index() in
  FiniteElementData has been removed. It had been deprecated a while
  back already. Please use FiniteElement::face_to_cell_index() instead.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/09)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: The typedefs DataOut::cell_iterator and
  DataOut::active_cell_iterator were previously defined as
  DoFHandler::(active)_cell_iterator, while they are now
  Triangulation::(active)_cell_iterator. This is necessary to support DataOut
  on multiple DoFHandler objects. This affects possible overloading of
  DataOut::next_cell(cell_iterator). Use the typedef
  DataOut::(active)_cell_iterator as argument type instead.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/07/24)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> New: step-26 fills a long-standing gap: There was no tutorial
          program solving the heat equation. There was also no tutorial
          showing in relatively easy terms how to do adaptive meshes
          in time dependent problems. This program fills both of these
          needs.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/18)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The build system now supports usage of the library
  out of the build directory without prior installation. This is done by
  exporting an additional project configuration just for the build directory.
  Furthermore, a bunch of convenience targets get now defined that just build
  individual components (such as just the documentation or the libraries), and
  if <tt>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</tt> is set, also install that specific component.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, Luca Heltai, 2013/12/03)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Missing instantiations of SparseDirectMUMPS have been added.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> New: introduced "make test" that runs a minimal set of tests. We
  encourage every user to run this, especially if they run in to problems.
  The tests are automatically picked depending on the configuration and
  will be shipped with every release.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Matthias Maier, 2013/11/08)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: It is now possible to restore a parallel Triangulation
  (and solutions) with a different number of processors it was saved with
  using Triangulation::save() and Triangulation::load().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/02)
  </li>

  <li> Added support for Windows: It is now possible again to use gcc on Windows
  in order to compile the library. We support gcc-4.8.1 on Cygwin64 and MinGW-w64.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/11/01)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: step-9, step-13 and step-14 have been converted to use the
  more modern WorkStream concept for assembling linear systems and computing
  error indicators in parallel.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/10/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: The testsuite is now ported to <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">
  CMake</a> and uses CTest as test driver.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Timo Heister, Matthias Maier, Bruno Turcksin, 2013/10/20)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: multithreadinfo::n_default_threads is now deprecated. Use the
  new n_threads() function instead, which works correctly with TBB.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/10/02)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: if configured with TBB but the number of threads is set to 1,
  do not bother to use TBB in workstream.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/10/02)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: step-51 demonstrates the use of hybridized discontinuous Galerkin
  methods in deal.II, using the face elements FE_FaceQ. The programs solves a
  scalar convection-diffusion equation.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler and Scott Miller, 2013/10/01)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: There is now an element FE_FaceP that can be combined with FE_DGP in
  hybridized DG methods.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/09/17)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: The DataOutBase::XDMFEntry class now has a proper serialization
  function to allow for checkpointing.
  <br>
  (Eric Heien, 2013/09/27)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: DataOutBase::DataOutFilter provides a way to remove duplicate vertices
  and values from a solution vector when generating output. Currently it only
  supports HDF5/XDMF output.
  <br>
  (Eric Heien, 2013/09/27)
  </li>

  <li>
  Removed: DataOutBase::HDF5MemStream was removed and the functionality replaced
  by DataOutBase::DataOutFilter. The user only manipulates these through
  DataOutBase::write_hdf5_parallel so this change should be transparent.
  <br>
  (Eric Heien, 2013/09/27)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: Like the usual DoFHandler class, the hp::DoFHandler class now also
  has a cache that makes operations such as <code>cell-@>get_dof_indices(...)</code>
  faster. This should accelerate many parts of the library that deal with
  hp finite elements.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/09/10)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation now supports periodic boundaries.
  DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints and similar functions are now working
  on parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects.
  <br>
  (Tobin Isaac, Craig Michoski, Daniel Arndt, 2013/09/06)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: It is now possible to compile and link deal.II against LLVM's libcxx. For
  this, a few issues with C++ standard violations are resolved.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/08/09)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Fixed: The DerivativeApproximation class did not work for
  parallel programs. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/18)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Move the implementation of Subscriptor::(un)subscribe() to
  the .cc file so that it is possible to link against the debug library
  without specifying <code>-DDEBUG</code>
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/13)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Since the introduction of ThreadLocalStorage in version 8.0, the
  way in which FEValues objects visit cells in a parallel assembly loop is no
  longer deterministic. Therefore, the detection of CellSimilarity that can
  speed up computations of certain geometric quantities (shape gradients) on
  cells that are translations is disabled when the number of threads is
  greater than one. This produces somewhat slower code (usually not more than
  a few percent) but ensures exact reproducibility of results.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Several functions in namespace GridTools were not instantiated
  for parallel::distributed::Triangulation objects. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/01)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The methods ConstraintMatrix::distribute_local_to_global
  now use scratch data that is private to each thread instead of allocating
  it for every cell anew. This gives better performance, in particular in
  parallel, of these operations, while maintaining thread-safety (when
  accessing non-overlapping rows, no race condition can exist).
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/12/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: When attempting operations such as FEValues::get_function_values()
  or FEValues::shape_value(), the FEValues object needs to know that what these
  functions return has been computed previously. What is computed is specified
  by the update flags that are passed to the constructor of all FEValues, FEFaceValues
  and FESubfaceValues objects. If a user attempts an operation for which the
  corresponding flag was not specified, an exception is generated. This exception
  did say previously what the cause was, but it was not overly explicit.
  The exception now generates a message that says exactly what is going wrong.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/01)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::truncated_cone() failed if half_length < 0.5*radius in 3d.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: make_hanging_node_constraints failed with an exception in a
  parallel::distributed computation if the element is
  RaviartThomas (and probably others).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/23)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: CMake: Added a configuration check for incompatible ninja
  + icc setup, fixed several setup and performance issues with the
  testsuite.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/11/20)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: when a dealii::Exception is thrown, defer the symbol lookup of the
  stack trace to when it is needed. This improves performance if what() is never
  called.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/17)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::parallelogram was not instantiated properly
  when using intel compilers.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/11/17)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: MappingQ1::transform_real_to_unit_cell() could fail in some
  cases with very elongated and twisted cells. This should now be fixed
  with an algorithm that uses a better method of computing the Newton
  convergence.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/11/17)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints had a bug that
  only appeared in rare cases at vertices of the domain if one adjacent
  cell had two boundary indicators selected for no normal flux and another
  had only one. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/11/17)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: dealii::FETools::interpolation_difference was
  not working for TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vectors with ghost
  entries. The TrilinosWrappers::VectorBase class has now a
  get_mpi_communicator method similar to the PETSc vector
  classes.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann, Martin Kronbichler, 2013/11/17)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Bundled fparser is now compiled with FP_USE_THREAD_SAFE_EVAL in
  case of enabled threading support so that it is thread safe.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, reported by Francesco Cattoglio 2013/11/16)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The CellData class now has a default constructor that
  sets the material and boundary indicators to zero. This fixes certain
  internal errors with the Intel ICC compiler.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/11/13)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: Removed obsolete files and files with unknown licensing
  status from the source tree. Along the way, parameter_gui now uses
  default icons from the desktop environment instead of bundled ones.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/11/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a framework for coloring graphs, with functions
  in namespace GraphColoring.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, Martin Kronbichler, 2013/11/06)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: the DerivativeApproximation class was not working correctly when
  used with parallel vectors.
  (Timo Heister, 2013/10/28)
  </li>

  <li>
  ~Subscriptor and ~GrowingVectorMemory no longer throw an exception (the
  former if disable_abort_on_exception was called) to be compatible with the
  C++11 standard which otherwise requires the program to immediately call
  std::terminate. This was done with a new macro "AssertNothrow".
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Matthias Maier, Bruno Turcksin 2013/10/22)
  </li>

  <li>
  dealii::SolverControl::NoConvergence now inherits dealii::ExceptionBase and
  is thrown via AssertThrow(false, ... ).
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/10/20)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: parallel::distributed::BlockVector has now methods update_ghost_values,
  compress, zero_out_ghosts, and has_ghost_elements that do the respective
  operation on each block of parallel::distributed::Vector.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/10/18)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: When deriving from DataOut to filter the cells where output is generated, there were two different bugs that result in segmentation faults or wrong cells written (example, step-18).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/10/16)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: GridIn::read_vtk() reads 2d and 3d meshes in VTK format.
  <br>
  (Mayank Sabharwal, Andreas Putz, 2013/10/07)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: ConstraintMatrix would not compress() the IndexSet in the constructor
  leading to crashes that only happen in release mode. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/09/27)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: PetscWrappers::MatrixBase::row_length() no longer worked after recent changes
  to PETSc (around PETSc release 3.4). This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/09/24)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: Added write_visit_record that allows writing .visit files with multiple blocks
  and multiple time steps.
  <br>
  (Fahad Alrashed, 2013/09/21)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: GridTools::have_same_coarse_mesh was only instantiated for
  MGDoFHandler arguments in debug mode. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/09/20)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point now throws the exception
  GridTools::ExcPointNotFound
  if the point is outside the Triangulation. This exception can be caught.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/09/18)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: we now call MPI_Init_thread instead of MPI_Init.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/09/17)
  </li>

  <li>
  Enhancement: It is now possible to use the build directory directly without
  the need to install first. For this, a second copy of all necessary project
  configuration files (deal.IIConfig.cmake, ..., Make.global_options) are
  generated and deployed in the build directory. (This is fully compatible with
  the old possibility to install into the build dir.)
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/09/15)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: DoFTools::extract_locally_*_dofs now instantiated for hp::DofHandler.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2013/09/11)
  </li>

  <li>
  Changed: distributed::parallel:BlockVector::operator= now allows importing
  of ghost values like all other vector types. Also added some new constructors
  for BlockVector and Vector using IndexSets to mirror the other linear algebra
  classes.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/09/04)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: VectorTools::compute_no_normal_flux_constraints had a bug that
  only manifested on complex meshes. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Chih-Che Chueh, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/09/04)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: All vector classes now have functions <code>extract_subvector_to()</code>
  that allow extracting not just a single value but a whole set.
  <br>
  (Fahad Alrashed, 2013/09/02)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: <code>common/Make.global_options</code> now exports enable-threads
  correctly, furthermore, <code>lib-suffix</code>, <code>shared-lib-suffix</code>
  and <code>static-lib-suffix</code> are now exported as well for better legacy
  support.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2013/08/30)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: The ParameterHandler class can now deal with including one parameter
  file from another.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/25)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: The method VectorTools::compute_normal_flux_constraints can be used to
  force a vector finite element function to be normal to the boundary.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/08/23)
  </li>

  <li>
  Improved: MappingQ now uses the points of the Gauss-Lobatto quadrature
  formula as support points instead of equispaced ones. This allows its use
  for high polynomial orders and also gives better interpolation of circular
  boundaries. Beware that mappings of order three and higher will behave
  slightly differently now (usually better).
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/08/23)
  </li>

  <li>
  Improved: Several .cc files in the deal.II directory have been split in
  order to better utilize multiple processors when compiling in parallel and
  reduce memory requirements of the compilation stage.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/08/22)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: The ParameterHandler::declare_entry() did not check that the
  default value of a parameter indeed satisfies the pattern given for this
  parameter (despite a statement in the documentation that this checking
  would happen). This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/21)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: Patterns::List and Patterns::Map now accept a string
  different than the default comma that denotes the separator
  between entries of the list or map.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/21)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: Some operations in the MappingQ class are now done in higher
  precision arithmetic to mitigate the ill-conditioning that appears
  when using mappings of high order (say, order 6 or 8 or 10).
  <br>
  (Juan Carlos Araujo Cabarcas, 2013/08/20)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: The SLEPcWrappers classes could not be compiled for 64-bit
  indices. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/20)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: SolutionTransfer used to crash whenever one transfered in the hp
  context between cells that use FE_Nothing and FE_Q. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Krzyszof Bzowski, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/18)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: Under some circumstances (see http://code.google.com/p/dealii/issues/detail?id=82)
  the DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints() function could create cycles in
  the ConstraintMatrix object. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (David Emerson, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/16)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: There is now a function ConstraintMatrix::are_identity_constrained().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/16)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: TableHandler::write_text() now also supports output in
  org-mode (http://orgmode.org/) format via a new entry in the
  TableHandler::TextOutputFormat enumeration.
  <br>
  (Oleh Krehel, 2013/08/15)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: There are now global functions <code>scalar_product</code>
  that compute the scalar product (double contraction) between
  tensors of rank 2.
  <br>
  (Scott Miller, 2013/08/14)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: Creating objects of type MappingQ was previously only possible
  for low order polynomials. For orders higher than around 6, one ran
  into assertions that tested for internal consistency. These assertions
  have now been appropriately relaxes for the growth of round-off errors
  with growing polynomial degrees.
  <br>
  (Juan Carlos Araujo Cabarcas, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/14)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: MappingQEulerian is now also instantiated for vector elements
  of type TrilinosWrappers::Vector as well as the MPI and block
  variants.
  <br>
  (Armin Ghajar Jazi, 2013/08/14)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: The FiniteElement::face_to_cell_index() function had a bug
  that made it work incorrectly for elements that have more than one
  degree of freedom per line (in 2d) or per quad (in 3d). This is now
  fixed for the most common cases, namely the FE_Q elements as well
  as elements composed of FESystem elements. For all other cases, an
  exception is generated reporting that this case is not implemented.
  If you run into this, let us know.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/10)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: DataOutBase::VtkFlags now has a flag
  DataOutBase::VtkFlags::print_date_and_time that can be used to suppress output
  of date and time in output files. This is useful in test suites where a newer
  run at a different time produces differences against previously stored files,
  even though the actual data is exactly the same.
  <br>
  (Oleh Krehel, 2013/08/06)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: The various block matrix classes are all derived from BlockMatrixBase
  which had race conditions when the set() or add() functions were called from
  different threads. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/05)
  </li>

  <li>
  Fixed: various fixes with assignment and reinit of PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/08/05)
  </li>

  <li>Fixed: An assertion wrongly triggered in
  DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints when used with a particular
  combination of FESystem elements containing FE_Nothing. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/08/01)
  </li>

  <li>
  New: Add has_ghost_elements() for PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockVector and
  TrilinosWrappers::MPI::BlockVector.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/08/01)
  </li>

  <li>
  SparsityTools::distribute_sparsity_pattern did not work correctly for
  block systems, this has been fixed (function has a different signature).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2013/07/31)
  </li>

  <li>Fixed: When typing <code>make run</code> in the step-32 directory,
  the program was executed with <code>mpirun -np 2 ./step-32</code>. This
  assumes that a program <code>mpirun</code> exists, but also does that
  deal.II was in fact compiled with MPI support on. Neither was intended.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/24)
  </li>

  <li>New: The DataOut, DataOutFaces, and DataOutRotation classes now allow
  the output of data vectors using different DoFHandler objects (based on the
  same triangulation), by new functions add_data_vector. This is used in the
  step-31 tutorial program which avoids creating a joint DoFHandler just for
  output.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/07/24)
  </li>

  <li>Changed: GridGenerator used to be a class with only static members
  but is now a namespace, like all other similar constructs in deal.II.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/24)
  </li>

  <li>Changed: In GridGenerator, several functions had erroneously been changed
  to take an argument of type <code>size_type</code> rather than <code>unsigned
  int</code>. <code>GridGenerator::size_type</code> was a typedef to
  types::global_dof_index, which for most users was <code>unsigned int</code>
  anyway, but could also be set to be a 64-bit integer type. In any case, the
  change has been reverted and these functions take just a regular
  <code>unsigned int</code> again.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/07/24)

<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Removed: The base class to the iterative linear solvers, Solver,
  received a SolverControl object upon construction and had a member
  function <code>control()</code> that returned a reference to the
  object previously passed in. The class now no longer stores such
  a reference, and consequently, the function has been removed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/10/24)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The constructor of the Utilities::MPI::MPI_InitFinalize
  class used to interpret a last argument equal to numbers::invalid_unsigned_int
  as @"<i>create as many threads as there are processor cores on the current
  system</i>@" for each MPI process. If there were multiple MPI processes on a
  given node, this would lead to (sometimes massive) overallocation of resources
  because <i>every</i> MPI process would create as many threads as there are cores.
  This has now been changed: an argument equal to numbers::invalid_unsigned_int
  is now interpreted as @"<i>subdivide the available cores between all MPI
  processes running on the current system and let each process create as many
  threads as cores were allocated to it</i>@".
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/16)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: CMake's configure phase no longer calls back into testsuite
  subprojects. If a build directory is reconfigured the testsuite has to be
  regenerated by hand using <code>make regen_tests</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/07/16)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: Class PointerMatrixBase (and, consequently, the various
  classes derived from it) had comparison operators that were intended to
  work generically for any kind of derived class. However, the implementation
  used a scheme that was not robust enough to handle the various situations
  that derived classes implemented and, consequently, was not always correct.
  These operators were not previously used inside the library and, likely,
  were not widely used in applications either. They have now been removed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/02/15)
  </li>

  <li> The change from functionparser to muparser introduced a small number of
  incompatibilities: units, use_degress, and recursion with 'eval' are no
  longer supported. Comparing for equality is done using '==' instead of '='.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/02/10)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The various classes generating graphical output, such
  as DataOut or DataOutStack, are all derived from a common interface
  class DataOutInterface which, in turn was derived from DataOutBase
  through <i>private</i> inheritance. Because we frequently also
  access the (public) members of this private base class this has tripped
  up most every compiler we know of at one point or another. Furthermore,
  because DataOutBase was a class that only defined static member functions
  and had not member variables, there was really no reason for this
  construct.
  <br>
  For these reasons, DataOutBase is now just a regular namespace and the
  inheritance is gone. For the most part, this should not lead to any
  incompatibilities except in cases where you accessed members of
  DataOutBase through their derived classes. For example, it was possible
  to write DataOut::Patch even though the
  Patch class is actually declared in DataOutBase. Since
  the inheritance is now gone, this is no longer possible and one
  actually has to write DataOutBase::Patch instead. Using this form
  turns out to be compatible also with older versions of deal.II.
  <br>

  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> New: Several parts of the library have been adjusted to allow
  compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio. Unfortunately, not all
  of the library can be compiled yet.
  <br>
  (Lukas Korous, 2014/12/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added support for OpenCASCADE (www.opencascade.org)
  library, which allows the use of arbitrary IGES files to describe
  the boundary of a mesh. The use of the new classes is described in
  the new Step-54.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, Andrea Mola, 2014/10/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: The classes implementing iterative solvers have gained
  a mechanism by which it is possible to observe the progress of
  the iterations, or to influence when to stop the iteration. The
  documentation of the Solver class now contains an extended
  discussion and example of this functionality.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/10/24)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a section in the introduction of step-36 that
  discusses the interaction of Dirichlet boundary values and the solution
  of eigenvalue problems.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/28)
  </li>

  <li> New: The glossary now contains an extensive entry on ghosted and
  non-ghosted vectors (see @ref GlossGhostedVector ).
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: MappingQ is now aware of
  Manifold, i.e., we can use high order mappings that
  actually follow the geometry also on the interior of codimension
  zero meshes.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/09/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: The new tutorial program step-52 explains how to use the
  new time stepping methods.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, Damien Lebrun-Grandie, 2014/09/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: The new tutorial program step-53 explains how to deal with
  complicated geometries.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Luca Heltai, 2014/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Namespace std_cxx1x has been renamed to namespace
  std_cxx11 to match the fact that the corresponding C++ standard
  was approved back in 2011. The old namespace name was retained for
  backward compatibility but is now deprecated.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/01)
  </li>

  <li> New: Most of the operations done on Vector (like add, sadd, etc.)
  are now vectorized (SIMD) using OpenMP 4.0.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, 2014/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Updated: The version of BOOST that comes bundled with deal.II has
  been updated to 1.56.0.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/08/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Newer versions of GCC (e.g. 4.9.x) are no longer compatible
  with BOOST 1.46. Consequently, the CMake scripts now require at least
  BOOST 1.48 in order to use a BOOST version found on the system. If no
  installed BOOST library is found, or if the version is older than 1.48,
  CMake will simply take the one that comes bundled with deal.II.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/08/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a documentation module that describes
  deal.II's support for and interaction with the
  @ref CPP11 "C++11 standard".
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/08/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added support for curved interior cells for all Triangulation
  dimensions.
  <br>
  A new Manifold<dim,spacedim> class was introduced which only contains the
  interface needed by Triangulation to refine objects, leaving all boundary
  related functions in the class Boundary<dim,spacedim>, which was made
  derived from Manifold<dim,spacedim>.
  <br>
  This new construction allows for curved interior cells, and custom refinement
  strategies (see, for example, the new tutorial program step-53).
  At the moment the following Manifolds are supported:
  <ul>
  <li> FlatManifold<dim,spacedim>: This class replaces the old
  StraightBoundary<dim,spacedim>, and it adds support for periodic
  manifolds. This is the simplest class one can use to create new Manifold classes;
  </li>
  <li> ManifoldChart<dim,spacedim,chartdim>: This is one of the most general Manifold
  one can think of. The user can overload the functions ManifoldChart::pull_back() and
  ManifoldChart::push_forward(), to obtain a very general curved geometry, following
  concepts typical of elasticity;
  </li>
  <li> SphericalManifold<dim,spacedim>: A simple implementation of spherical coordinates
  transformations. This manifold allows hyper shells with curved interior cells which
  follow the natural shape of the shell;
  </li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  The functions
  Triangulation::set_boundary() and Triangulation::get_boundary() can still be used to
  set and get Boundary objects instead of Manifold ones. For the get function, an exception
  is thrown if a conversion to a valid Boundary class cannot be made on the fly.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/08/06)
  </li>

  <li> Ported: The build system now supports CMake 3.0.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/07/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added support for curved interior boundaries, and general
  manifold id description.
  <br>
  A new attribute was added to each triangulation object
  (types::manifold_id) which allows one to specify a manifold
  description, much in the same way we do for boundaries, also for
  interior edges and faces. At the moment this information is used
  only for objects of topological dimension less than spacedim, but a
  generalization of the class Boundary<dim,spacedim> is on its way to
  allow also curved cells.
  <br>
  For the moment, full backward compatibility is granted, and one can
  keep using the old Boundary<dim,spacedim>, together with
  Triangulation::set_boundary(), and Triangulation::get_boundary()
  methods. However, this change suggests to use the types::boundary_id associated
  with each boundary face to indicate only boundary condition types, and
  it allows to separate the geometric meaning from the physical meaning. The
  suggested usage is
  - types::boundary_id is used for the physical meaning
  - types::manifold_id is used for the geometric meaning.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/07/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: Tutorial programs (and a few other places) are now cross-linked
  to their corresponding video lectures.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/10)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functionparser library bundled with deal.II got replaced
  by the <a href="http://muparser.beltoforion.de/">muparser</a> library.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/02/10)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: It was possible to call DoFCellAccessor::set_active_fe_index()
  on non-active cells. However, this made no sense: Since degrees of
  freedoms only exist on active cells
  for hp::DoFHandler (i.e., there is currently no implementation
  of multilevel hp::DoFHandler objects), it does not make sense
  to assign active FE indices to non-active cells since they
  do not have finite element spaces associated with them without
  having any degrees of freedom.
  <br>
  The same of course is true for asking for the finite element active
  on a non-active cell, i.e. using the functions
  DoFAccessor::active_fe_index() and
  DoFAccessor::get_fe(). All of these functions now produce exceptions on
  non-active cells.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/24)
  </li>

  <li> New: deal.II now links with the
  <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/iostreams/doc/index.html">BOOST
  Iostreams</a> library (at least if the libz and libbz2 libraries
  can be found that are necessary for BOOST Iostreams).
  Among many other things, this allows to easily
  read files that have been compressed, as in the following code snippet:
  @code
    #include <boost/iostreams/filtering_stream.hpp>
    #include <boost/iostreams/filter/gzip.hpp>
    #include <boost/iostreams/device/file.hpp>

    ...

    boost::iostreams::filtering_istream in;
    in.push(boost::iostreams::basic_gzip_decompressor<>());
    in.push(boost::iostreams::file_source("myfile.gz"));

<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Fixed: CMake now correctly detects -Wno-... support for gcc.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: The FE_Q and FE_Q_Hierarchical classes now include pictures
  of their 2d shape functions in the class documentation.
  <br>
  (Manuel Quezada de Luna, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Calling DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee threw an exception
  whenever one of the processors of a parallel triangulation did not own
  any degrees of freedom.
  <br>
  (Michal Wichrowski, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/04)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Serializing an object of type DoFHandler did not work without
  including additional header files.
  <br>
  (David Wells, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/11/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: The class FEEvaluation with its fast tensor evaluation routines
  can now be initialized from a mapping, a finite element, a quadrature, and
  update flags on the fly similar to FEValues. This provides an alternative
  entry point to these routines without the need to create a MatrixFree data
  object.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/11/20)
  </li>

  <li> New: Complete the interface for periodic boundary conditions.
  Now, it is possible to specify an additional (geometric) rotation matrix along
  with vector components that should be rotated when applying periodic boundary
  conditions (or alternatively, directly a transformation matrix working
  directly on dofs). With this it is now possible to e.g. compute Stokes flow
  on a quarter pie with periodic boundary conditions and the velocity correctly
  transformed.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, Matthias Maier, 2014/11/19)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Vector updates in PreconditionChebyshev based on deal.II's own
  vectors are now vectorized with OpenMP 4.0 SIMD pragmas.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, Bruno Turcksin, 2014/11/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added support for STEP files in the OpenCASCADE
  wrappers. STEP files can now be imported and exported respectively
  with the OpenCASCADE::read_STEP() and OpenCASCADE::write_STEP() functions.
  <br>
  (Andrea Mola, 2014/11/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: Timer now has get_lap_time() which returns the time
  lapsed between the last start()/stop() cycle.
  <br>
  (Fahad Alrashed, 2014/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridTools::get_locally_owned_vertices() allows to query
  which vertices of a triangulation are owned by the current
  processor.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::communicate_locally_moved_vertices()
  allows to
  update vertex positions that have been moved just locally on distributed
  meshes. GridTools::distort_random now works for distributed meshes and
  hanging nodes in 3D as well.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2014/11/06)
  </li>

  <li> New: TableHandler objects can be cleared - i.e. reset to a
  zero-sized state.
  <br>
  (Fahad Alrashed, 2014/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: The FE_Nothing class now has a second template argument
  corresponding to the space dimension in which the mesh is embedded,
  like many other classes. This allows to use this element in codimension
  one cases as well now.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/11/05)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Using the FEEvaluation framework did not work for
  scalar elements in 1d because there were conflicting partial
  specializations. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Shiva Rudraraju, 2014/11/04)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a macro <code>DEAL_II_VERSION_GTE</code>
  that can be used to test whether the deal.II version is greater
  than or equal a particular version number. This is useful if you
  need to make application programs compatible with different
  deal.II releases.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/10/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: The vector classes in deal.II (including Trilinos and PETSc
  wrappers) now have a new method x.add_and_dot(factor,v,w) which performs
  x.add(factor,v) and subsequent inner product of x with another vector
  w. This operation occurs in some iterative solvers; by a combined operation,
  reduced memory transfer and thus higher performance are enabled.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/10/27)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Inner products and norms on deal.II's own vector classes now
  use vectorization through VectorizedArray if available.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/10/27)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: PETSc and Trilinos vectors with ghost entries can now be reset to zero
  using = 0.0;
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/10/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: The new function FiniteElement::get_associated_geometry_primitive() allows to
  query whether a given degree of freedom is associated with a vertex, line,
  quad, or hex.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/26)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The vector and array versions of Utilities::MPI::sum() and
  Utilities::MPI::max() produced segmentation faults with some MPI implementations
  if the input and output arguments were the same. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Trying to have FE_Q(p) and FE_DGQ(r) elements next to each
  other in an hp::DoFHandler object led to assertions saying that these two
  elements don't know how to compute interface constraints where such
  elements touch. This has now been fixed: FE_DGQ is a discontinuous element,
  so there cannot be any interface constraints at all.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/26)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The function TrilinosWrappers::VectorBase::sadd(double factor,
  VectorBase &v) erroneously added factor*v instead of scaling the calling
  vector by factor. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/09/26)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The function TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::add(double factor,
  SparseMatrix &rhs) produced wrong results and ran into an exception if the
  rhs matrix included off-processor column entries. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/09/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: The function Threads::Task::joinable() can be used to verify whether
  a task object can be joined or not.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added two optional parameters to TriaAccessor::center()
  and a new method TriaAccessor::intermediate_point().
  They allow to query for a
  geometrically coherent center, or ask for arbitrary points on the
  underlying Manifold, given the dim coordinates in the reference
  element.
  Triangulation was refactored internally to use the new
  TriaAccessor::center() interface when querying for new points.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/09/13)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Optimize construction of high-order FE_Nedelec by moving out some
  non-essential computations. Namely, construct restriction and prolongation
  matrices on first request. This reduces time spent in FE_Nedelec constructor
  substantially.
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, 2014/08/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a GridGenerator::flatten_triangulation()
  taking a Triangulation<dim, spacedim_1> as input and returning
  a Triangulation<dim, spacedim_2> as output. The output
  triangulation will contain a single level with all active
  cells of the input triangulation, and will be topologically
  equivalent to the input triangulation. If the two space dimensions
  are equal, then this function will copy the triangulation
  removing all levels, e.g., flattening it. If the two space dimensions
  are different, then this function will copy the vertices only
  up to the smallest space dimension parameter. <br>
  Using this function, you can create a Triangulation<2,3> from
  a Triangulation<2,2> or project to the plane z=0 your
  Triangulation<2,3>. No checks are performed on the validity of
  the resulting Triangulation.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/08/19)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functions GridTools::extract_boundary_mesh() and
  GridTools::create_union_triangulation() have been moved to
  GridGenerator::extract_boundary_mesh() and
  GridGenerator::create_union_triangulation() since, conceptually, they
  generate meshes. The old functions have been retained but are now
  deprecated.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/08/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: TriaAccessor::measure() is now also implemented for faces of
  3d cells as long as the face is planar.
  <br>
  (Kevin Drzycimski, 2014/08/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Support SLEPc 3.5 by disabling SDFOLD spectrum transformation type
  that has been removed from SLEPc. Therefore, TransformationSpectrumFolding
  cannot be used with newer SLEPc versions.
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, 2014/08/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: To better support applications that want to use C++11's
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B11#Range-based_for_loop">range-based
  for loops</a>, there are now functions Triangulation::cell_iterators(),
  Triangulation::all_cell_iterators() and similarly in classes DoFHandler
  and hp::DoFHandler
  that return a range object that can then be used in range-based for loops.
  The underlying implementation uses the new IteratorRange class.
  <br>
  See the new @ref CPP11 "C++11" page for more information.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/08/07)
  </li>

  <li> New: The new class FunctionManifold allows arbitrary manifold descriptions, in which you have
  an explicit Function<chartdim> for the ManifoldChart::push_forward()
  method, and an explicit Function<spacedim> for ManifoldChart::pull_back()
  method (or an expression for both). In these cases, you can construct a
  Manifold description on the fly.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/08/07)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added CylindricalManifold description.
  <br>
  This class allows refinement of cylindrical manifolds. It is a good
  companion for GridGenerator::cylinder() and the perfect companion
  for GridGenerator::cylinder_shell().
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/08/06)
  </li>

  <li> New: TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionAMG can now be initialized from an
  object of type Epetra_RowMatrix, which allows using it with more arbitrary
  matrix objects, including matrix-free methods.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/08/06)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The FE_Nedelec element computed face interpolation matrices
  wrongly for elements of order p>1. This also led to trouble computing
  hanging node constraints in the context of hp adaptivity. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, 2014/08/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: The function GridTools::get_patch_around_cell() extracts
  the set of cells that surround a single cell. The new functions
  DoFTools::count_dofs_on_patch() and DoFTools::get_dofs_on_patch()
  then help set up local problem on patches.
  <br>
  (Arezou Ghesmati, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Utilities::string_to_int() and
  Utilities::string_to_double() did not catch if the
  string given started with an integer or double but contained additional
  text. They now throw an exception if this happens.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/20)
  </li>

  <li> New: The function GridOut::write can now be used also in
  the codimension one case.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/07/18)
  </li>

  <li> New: The Function classes now take an additional optional
  template argument, specifying the type of number to use, which defaults
  to double.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/07/18)
  </li>

  <li> New: The GridReordering::reorder_cells() function used a
  numbering format for the vertices in a cell that was last used in
  deal.II version 5.2. This format is still used internally, but
  the function now also understands the numbering that has been
  used in deal.II ever since. The choice is made by an additional
  argument to the function that defaults to the old-style
  format for backward compatibility.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now functions GridOut::write_vtk() and
   GridOut::write_vtu() that can
  write a mesh in VTK/VTU format.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/14)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: PETSc up to at least version 3.5 has a bug where it does
  not zero-initialize the ghost elements of a newly created ghosted
  parallel vector. This is now worked around inside deal.II.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Michal Wichrowski, 2014/07/12)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The Trilinos direct solver, TrilinosWrappers::SolverDirect,
  now takes a string to select among the available Amesos solvers. Moreover,
  the solver now also supports deal.II's distributed vectors.
  <br>
  (Uwe K&ouml;cher, Martin Kronbichler, 2014/07/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now three new preconditioner classes
  TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBlockJacobi,
  TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBlockSSOR, and
  TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionBlockSOR that work on small dense blocks of
  the global matrix instead of the point-wise relaxation methods in
  TrilinosWrappers::Precondition{Jacobi,SSOR,SOR} that work on each row
  separately.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/07/04)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Some versions of DoFTools::extract_boundary_dofs() were
  not instantiated for some combinations of arguments. This could lead
  to missing symbol errors during linking of applications on some
  platforms and with some compiler versions. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/07/04)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::merge_triangulations sometimes produced invalid
  orientations of faces. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2014/06/30)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionAMG did not read user-provided
  constant modes (aka null space) when the null space dimension is one but not
  just the trivial one vector. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/06/30)
  </li>

  <li> Simplified interfaces for FEEvaluation: Previously, the user had to
  select the appropriate kernel (FEEvaluation, FEEvaluationGeneral,
  FEEvaluationDGP, FEEvaluationGL) for the matrix-free evaluation
  routines. This made it difficult to write compact code that needs to select
  between different elements. Therefore, all the functionality has been merged
  into FEEvaluation and one should only use FEEvaluation, while the other
  interfaces have been marked deprecated and will be removed in a future
  version. The internal data structures for the various special cases have
  been kept in order to provide for the most efficient routines, and are
  selected at construction of FEEvaluation.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/06/27)
  </li>

  <li> Bugfix: TBB specific include directories have to be added to the
  list of user include directories because of direct inclusion of header
  files in base/thread_local_storage.h.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, Kainan Wang, 2014/06/25)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: GridGenerator::hyper_cube() accepts a
  <code>colorize</code> argument.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2014/06/23)
  </li>

  <li> New: %Functions DoFTools::extract_locally_relevant_dofs(),
  parallel::distributed::GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_number() and
  parallel::distributed::GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction() are
  now also instantiated for objects of codimension 1.
  <br>
  (Michal Wichrowski, 2014/06/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now functions Triangulation::has_hanging_nodes()
  and parallel::distributed::Triangulation::has_hanging_nodes().
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2014/06/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now function Triangulation::n_global_active_cells().
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2014/06/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: The class FEEvaluation now provides optimized matrix-free
  evaluation routines for FE_Q_DG0 elements.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/06/13)
  </li>

  <li> Bugfix: Filter libclang_rt* from the PETSc link line.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/06/04)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: ParameterHandler parsing added to DoFOutputOperator
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2014/06/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Algorithms::ThetaTimestepping and other operators now use AnyData
  to communicate with operators they rely on. This way, time step data
  can be forwarded using the same mechanism, and no complicated back
  access to member data is required
  anymore. MeshWorker::IntegrationInfo uses AnyData as well.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2014/06/03)
  </li>

  <li> Bugfix: CMake: Also clean CMAKE_MODULE_PATH prior to call to
  FIND_PACKAGE(Boost) inside FindBOOST.cmake because apparently
  "Boost" == "BOOST" for the Mac file system...
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/05/28)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: CMake: Search results and error conditions for external
  libraries are now much more verbose. Added an MPI sanity check.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/05/28)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() variant that works
  on PETSc matrices could produce a deadlock in parallel if one processor
  had no boundary values to apply. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Michal Wichrowski, 2014/05/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: AnyData::try_read() is a function that allows users to check
  whether an entry exists and get a pointer to it without throwing an
  exception in case of failure.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2014/05/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: The GMRES solver of deal.II can now write an estimate of
  eigenvalues to the log file, in analogy to the CG solver. This is enabled
  by the flag SolverGMRES::AdditionalData::compute_eigenvalues.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/05/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: The GridIn::read_vtk() function places fewer restrictions
  on the VTK files it wants to read and should, consequently, be able
  to read more correctly formatted VTK files than before.
  <br>
  (Giorgos Kourakos, 2014/05/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a QSorted quadrature which takes an
  arbitrary quadrature at construction time and reorders the quadrature
  points according to the weights, from smaller to bigger. This should
  improve stability of higher order polynomial integration.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2014/05/07)
  </li>

  <li> New: The class VectorizedArray<Number> now provides methods
  VectorizedArray::load(ptr) to read from arbitrary pointer addresses and
  VectorizedArray::store(ptr) to write to arbitrary pointer addresses,
  as opposed to the data layout of VectorizedArray that requires pointers
  to be aligned by the size of the array in bytes. This also circumvents
  a (rare) compiler optimization bug with gcc-4.6 on SSE code in combination
  with function calls, e.g. to std::sin.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/05/05)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Namespace SparsityTools had a local typedef <code>size_type</code>
  that was set equal to types::global_dof_index. This typedef has been removed
  and we now use SparsityPattern::size_type wherever applicable as this is the
  type we really want to use. (The code worked previously because
  types::global_dof_index and SparsityPattern::size_type happen to be the same
  as far as the underlying type is concerned; however, they are different
  semantically.)
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/05/04)
  </li>

  <li> Updated: The step-16 tutorial program was updated to the new layout
  multigrid objects and thus avoids using deprecated interfaces.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/05/03)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FE_DGQArbitraryNodes::has_support_on_face was broken when
  polynomials with support points not on the element boundary were used.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/04/30)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::load now has an
  additional parameter <code>autopartition</code> to control p4est's behavior of
  rebalancing triangulations between MPI nodes upon reading. It is
  particularly useful to disable this behavior when data is stored
  separately (examples for this are in the regression tests mpi/p4est_save_0?).
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, Matthias Maier, 2014/04/26)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridTools::find_active_cell_around_point() could get into an infinite
  loop if the point we are looking for is in fact not within the domain. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (Giorgos Kourakos, Timo Heister, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/04/14)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: TableBase now uses AlignedVector for storing data
  instead of std::vector, which allows its use for VectorizedArray<Number>
  data fields which require more alignment.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/04/09)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Piola transformation for FE_BDM is now active.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2014/04/09)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: operator< for cell iterators no longer looks at
  (level-)subdomain ids but only compares level() and index(). This makes the
  ordering inconsistent between processes on a
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation, but fixes the problem that the
  ordering of cells changes under mesh refinement or other causes for changing
  the subdomain id.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/04/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridTools::laplace_transform() now takes an additional, optional
  parameter that indicates the "stiffness" of the mapping.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2014/04/07)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: DoFTools::extract_constant_modes now correctly identifies both
  constant modes in the scalar element FE_Q_DG0, which has been realized by a
  few modifications in how the constant modes propagate from the element to
  the extract_constant_modes() function.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/04/04)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridTools::laplace_transform had previously announced in
  the documentation that one can also set the location of interior points,
  but this was not in fact what was implemented. This has now been fixed:
  the code can now do that.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/03/23)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Inhomogeneous tangential and normal flow constraints can
       now be treated via VectorTools::compute_nonzero_normal_flux_constraints
       and VectorTools::compute_nonzero_tangential_flux_constraints.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2014/03/16)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Class TriaAccessor had a function parent_index(), but this function
  could only work for cell accessors. The function has consequently been moved
  to class CellAccessor.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/03/15)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: step-32 had a piece of code where we accessed an internal
  representation of how Trilinos vectors are actually stored. This is poor
  style and has been rewritten.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/03/14)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::project_boundary_values_curl_conforming contained
  a bug for some cases. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Markus B&uuml;rg, 2014/03/10)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: ParameterHandler will no longer output an error if the file
  to be read ends with "end" without a newline.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/02/28)
  </li>

  <li>Improved: DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee can now run with distributed
  triangulations with the renumbering only done within each processor's
  subdomain.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/02/20)

  <li>Fixed: There was an indexing error in GridIn::read_vtk() that triggered
  for some input files. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Mayank Sabharwal, 2014/02/19)

  <li>New: There is a new namespace TimeStepping for the algorithms that do time
  integrations. In this new namespace, several Runge-Kutta methods have been
  implemented: explicit methods, implicit methods, and embedded explicit methods.
  <br>
  (Damien Lebrun-Grandie, Bruno Turcksin, 2014/02/17)

  <li>New: There is now a class FEEvaluationDGP that implements matrix-free
  evaluation routines by truncated tensor products for FE_DGP elements.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/02/17)

  <li>Changed: The InverseMatrixRichardson used to eat all exceptions
  that may have been produced by the underlying Richardson solver, leaving
  no trace that the underlying solver may have failed when you call functions
  such as InverseMatrixRichardson::vmult(). These exceptions are now propagated
  out to the caller.

  <li>New: FE_TraceQ implements finite elements on faces, which
  correspond to the traces of H<sup>1</sup>-conforming elements.
  <br>
  (Angela Klewinghaus, 2014/02/14)

  <li>New: FE_FaceQ and FE_FaceP now also work in 1D (with a single dof
  on each vertex).
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/02/11)

  <li>Fixed: FE_DGQ::has_support_on_face returned a wrong number for element
  degree larger than 1 in 1D. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/02/10)

  <li>Changed: DerivativeApproximation used to be a class that only had
  static members. It is now a namespace.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/02/08)

  <li>New: Threads::ThreadLocalStorage::clear() clears out all objects allocated on the
  current and all other threads.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/02/06)

  <li>Fixed: A configuration error on Debian Testing where accidentally a
  non-pic libSuiteSparse_config.a was picked up when building a shared
  library up resulting in a link error.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/02/04)

  <li> Changed: GridTools::transform() can now deal with meshes with hanging nodes.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/02/04)
  </li>

  <li>Fixed: Calling FEValuesViews::Vector::get_function_curls() computed
  wrong results in some cases (see https://code.google.com/p/dealii/issues/detail?id=182).
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Christoph Heiniger, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/02/03)

  <li>Added: The class LAPACKFullMatrix now implements interfaces to
  matrix-matrix multiplication. Also, LAPACKFullMatrix::apply_lu_factorization
  now also operates on multiple right hand sides in form of another
  LAPACKFullMatrix.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/02/03)

  <li>Fixed: The build system does no longer record full paths to system
  libraries but uses the appropriate short names instead.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/02/01)

  <li>Reworked: External feature setup. Disabling a feature now cleans up
  associated internal, cached variables. A per-feature linkage test now spots
  common linking inconsistencies early in the configuration stage (and not
  just after a complete compilation).
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/02/01)

  <li>New/fixed: The ParameterHandler::print_parameters_section
  method did not work for XML output. There is now a flag
  include_top_level_elements which prints all higher
  subsection elements, default is false.
  For XML output setting this flag to true is required
  to ensure that the output is a valid XML document,
  starting with one root element ParameterHandler and
  compatible with read_input_from_xml and the parameterGUI.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann, 2014/02/01)

  <li>New: There is now a method to copy the content from a
  PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector and TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector to
  deal.II's parallel distributed vector.
  <br>
  (Ben Thompson, Martin Kronbichler, 2014/01/31)

  <li>Fixed: The SolutionTransfer class had all sorts of problems when
  used with hp::DoFHandler that made its results at least questionable.
  Several parts of this class have been rewritten to make the results
  more predictable and, likely, more correct.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/26)

  <li>Fixed: A regression where a single whitespace accidentally added to
  DEAL_II_LINKER_FLAGS internally prevented cmake-2.8.8 from configuring
  successfully.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, Krysztof Bzowski, 2014/01/26)

  <li> Fixed: SparsityPattern::max_entries_per_row() forgot to consider
  the last row of the matrix and consequently sometimes returned
  wrong values. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/01/22)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: In rare cases when the vector of error indicators
  has entries equal to zero the adjust_interesting_range method
  produces a negative lower bound. As a result the
  parallel::distributed::GridRefinement::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_*
  methods flagged the wrong number of cells for coarsening and refinement.
  This is now changed by adjusting the lower bound in adjust_interesting_range
  only, if not equal to zero.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann, 2014/01/22)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: It was previously possible to set the
  <code>active_fe_index</code> on non-active cells of an hp::DoFHandler.
  However, this was prone to mistakes because it may lead to the assumption
  that a finite element space out of the ones described by the hp::FECollection
  associated with this hp::DoFHandler was actually associated with such
  a cell. Since we do not actually distribute degrees of freedom for such
  hp::DoFHandler objects on non-active cells, this is not the case. Consequently,
  it no longer has any effect to assign active FE indices to non-active cells:
  these values are simply reset later on.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The method DoFTools::extract_constant_modes only worked for
  elements where the constant function 1 is represented by all ones. This
  is now fixed by querying the element for its constant modes on each cell.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector::all_zero() was broken with more than
  one processor (illegal memory access) and did not communicate between all
  processors. Documentation for many vector types of all_zero() has been extended.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2014/01/17)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed/new: DoFCellAccessor::set_dof_values_by_interpolation and
  DoFCellAccessor::get_interpolated_dof_values could previously be
  called for hp::DoFHandler objects on cells that are non-active. This
  makes no sense since these cells have no associated finite element
  space. Doing so now raises an exception.
  <br>
  However, there are legitimate cases where one may want to interpolate
  from children to a parent's finite element space or the other way around.
  Since in the hp
  case no finite element space is naturally associated with an inactive
  cell, it is now possible to pass an explicit finite element index
  argument to these functions specifying which element of an hp::FECollection
  object describes the space onto which you want to interpolate.
  <br>
  (Mihai Alexe, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/18)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The methods IndexSet::do_compress() and
  IndexSet::add_indices(IndexSet&) had quadratic complexity in the number of
  ranges. The algorithms have been changed into linear complexity ones.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2014/01/15)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: There were several bugs in functions like
  FEValues::get_function_values() where the code did not properly handle the
  case of FE_Nothing. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/08)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: DataOut got confused in some situations where one uses FE_Nothing.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Minh Do-Quang, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/08)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FESystem::get_interpolation_matrix, a function that is among
  other places used by SolutionTransfer, had a bug that prevented it from
  running correctly in some situations where one uses FE_Nothing.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Minh Do-Quang, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/01/08)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: When you call WorkStream::run with an empty function object
  for the copier, operations on individual cells are essentially all independent.
  In other words, you have a massively parallel collection of jobs. In this
  case, a parallel for loop over all elements is better suited than the
  pipeline approach currently used. This has now been implemented.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: The new function VectorTools::interpolate_based_on_material_id()
  can be used to interpolate several functions onto a mesh, based on the
  material id of each cell individually.
  <br>
  (Valentin Zingan, 2013/12/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new reinit() method has been introduced to
  TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern that takes all rows that are possibly
  written into as an optional argument. This allows for pre-allocating all
  possible entries right away, which makes writing into the matrix from
  several threads possible (otherwise, only one processor at a time can write
  off-processor data). Similarly, TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector objects can
  be initialized with hints to ghost elements for a writable vector that can
  be added into from multiple threads.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/12/23)
  </li>

  <li> New: The TableBase::fill function has become more powerful in that
  it now doesn't just take pointers to initializing elements but can deal
  with arbitrary input iterators. It now also takes a flag that denotes the
  order in which table elements are initialized, allowing to switch between
  C- and Fortran-style table layouts.
  <br>
  Along with the TableBase::fill function, the Table classes of various
  ranks have also gotten constructors that allow the in-place construction
  not only of a table of correct size, but already initialized from
  somewhere. This finally allows to mark Table objects as const by creating
  them already with the correct content.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new class Functions::InterpolatedTensorProductGridData that can
  be used to (bi-/tri-)linearly interpolate data given on a tensor product
  mesh of $x$ (and $y$ and $z$) values, for example to evaluate experimentally
  determined coefficients, or to assess the accuracy of a solution by
  comparing with a solution generated by a different code and written in
  gridded data. There is also a new class Functions::InterpolatedUniformGridData that
  can perform the same task more efficiently if the data is stored on meshes
  that are uniform in each coordinate direction.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: ParameterHandler::get_double() and ParameterHandler::get_integer()
  had bugs in that they didn't detect if they were asked to return a number
  for a parameter whose value was in fact not a number but some general
  text. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2013/12/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::project_boundary_values could not deal with
  function values close to (but not exactly equal to) zero. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2013/12/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: It is now possible to select between different smoothers and coarse
  solvers in the Trilinos AMG preconditioners by a string to the smoother's name.
  <br>
  (Andrew Baker, 2013/12/14)

<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>

  <li>Changed: GridTools::distort_random is now deterministic (gives the same
  distorted mesh when called with the same input Triangulation).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/09)
  </li>

  <li>Changed: MatrixCreator::create_mass_matrix() took matrix and vector
  objects where the scalar type of the matrix was a template argument
  but the scalar type of the vector was always <code>double</code>. This
  has been changed so that the two always need to match.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/06/17)
  </li>

  <li>Changed: Functions such as FEValuesBase::get_function_values() that
  extracted the values of functions at the quadrature points of a cell
  implicitly always assumed that <code>double</code> is a reasonable
  type to store the result in. This, however, is not true if the solution
  vector's underlying scalar type was, for example,
  <code>std::complex@<double@></code>. All of the functions of
  FEValuesBase as well as of the various FEValuesViews class that extract
  values from solution vectors have been changed so that they now return
  their results in vectors that use the same underlying scalar type
  (float, double, or std::complex) as was used in the solution vector.
  <br>
  Most user codes will be entirely unaffected by this because they simply
  use the default vector types which all store their data as doubles.
  You may have to adjust your code, though, if you use non-standard
  types such as Vector@<float@> for solution vectors, or use
  complex-valued data types. This includes compiling PETSc with
  complex scalars.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/05/08)
  </li>

  <li>Removed: The generic, templated vmult, Tvmult, etc. -interfaces of
  LAPACKFullMatrix - they were never implemented.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li>Removed: SparseDirectUMFPACK::vmult_add and
  SparseDirectUMFPACK::Tvmult_add - they were never implemented.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li>Removed: The class NamedData has been removed after it had been
  superseded by AnyData a while ago. This affects the use of classes
  in Algorithms and MeshWorker
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2015/04/02)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The CMake configuration does not use the variable
  <code>DEAL_II_CMAKE_MACROS_RELDIR</code> any more. Instead, the fixed
  location <code>\${DEAL_II_SHARE_RELDIR}/macros</code> is used
  unconditionally
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/03/26)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::clear_row() function used
  to call TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::compress() before doing its work,
  but this is neither efficient nor safe. You will now have to do this
  yourself after assembling a matrix and before clearing rows.
  <br>
  The changes to the function above also affect the
  MatrixTools::apply_boundary_values() variants that operate on Trilinos
  matrices.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/09)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Implicit conversion from Tensor@<1,dim@> to Point@<dim@> was
  previously possible. This has now been prohibited (but you can still
  do the conversion with an explicit cast) as such conversions are
  likely incorrect uses of class Point (which should represent only
  points in space, i.e., vectors anchored at the origin) whereas Tensor
  should be used for vectors anchored elsewhere (such as normal vectors,
  directions, differences between points, etc). The difference in
  usage between Point and Tensor have now been clarified in the documentation
  of class Point.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The project configuration no longer exports
  <code>[...]/include/deal.II</code>. Thus it is now mandatory to prefix
  all includes of deal.II headers with <code>deal.II/</code>, i.e.
  <code>#include &lt;deal.II/[...]&gt;</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: ParameterHandler::leave_subsection() no longer returns a bool
  indicating if there was a subsection to leave. This never worked in the
  first place, because an exception was thrown.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: Make.global_options was completely redesigned. It still
  contains Makefile sourcable information, but they now closely mimic the
  declarative style of deal.IIConfig.cmake. Thus, projects that still use
  Makefiles that source Make.global_options have to be ported to the new
  layout.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The Component <code>compat_files</code> was removed entirely. deal.II
  now always configures and installs with a somewhat FSHS compliant
  directory structure. Further, the ancient make_dependencies binary was
  removed. Either migrate your project to CMake, or port your build system
  to the new (incompatible) Make.global_options found at
  <code>\${DEAL_II_SHARE_RELDIR}</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The two-argument call to the MPI_InitFinalize constructor
  used to imply that the user wanted only one thread per MPI process. This
  has been changed and now means that every processor core on the system is
  used. If you run as many MPI processes as there are processor cores, then
  this means one thread per MPI process, as before. On the other hand, if you
  start fewer MPI processes than there are cores, then your program will now
  be allowed to use more than one thread. You can get the old behavior by
  setting the third (optional) argument to one.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/14)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix copy constructor got removed
  to be in line with PETSc and dealii::SparseMatrix. You can use reinit()
  and copy_from().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The following compatibility definitions were removed from
  <code>include/deal.II/base/config.h.in</code> (replacement in brackets):
  - DEAL_II_CAN_USE_CXX11 (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_CAN_USE_CXX1X (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_COMPILER_SUPPORTS_MPI (new: DEAL_II_WITH_MPI)
  - DEAL_II_MAJOR (new: DEAL_II_VERSION_MAJOR)
  - DEAL_II_MINOR (new: DEAL_II_VERSION_MINOR)
  - DEAL_II_USE_ARPACK (new: DEAL_II_WITH_ARPACK)
  - DEAL_II_USE_CXX11 (new: DEAL_II_WITH_CXX11)
  - DEAL_II_USE_METIS (new: DEAL_II_WITH_METIS)
  - DEAL_II_USE_MT (new: DEAL_II_WITH_THREADS)
  - DEAL_II_USE_P4EST (new: DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST)
  - DEAL_II_USE_PETSC (new: DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC)
  - DEAL_II_USE_SLEPC (new: DEAL_II_WITH_SLEPC)
  - DEAL_II_USE_TRILINOS (new: DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS)
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The direct Mumps interface through
  <code>SparseDirectMUMPS</code> has been removed. The MUMPS solver is
  still available through the Trilinos or PETSc interfaces. Alternatively,
  there is <code>SparseDirectUMFPACK</code>, which has a similar interface.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/11)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: This release removes a number of functions that have long
  been deprecated and that were previously already marked as
  deprecated (i.e., they would have yielded warnings by the compiler whenever
  you tried to use them). In almost all cases, there is a function with same
  name but different argument list that should be used instead.
  Specifically, the removed functions and classes are:
  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/base/</code>:</em>
  - ThreadManagement::spawn.
  - Threads::ThreadCondition and Threads::ThreadMutex.
  - DataOutBase::create_xdmf_entry with 3 arguments.
  - DataOutBase::write_hdf5_parallel with 2 arguments.
  - The versions of FunctionParser::initialize that took a
    <code>use_degrees</code> or <code>constants</code> argument.
    The implementation as it is now no longer supports either of
    these two concepts (since we switched from the FunctionParser
    library to the muparser library after the deal.II 8.1 release).
  - GridOutFlags::XFig::level_color.
  - class BlockList.
  - The MPI support functions in namespace Utilities and Utilities::System.
  - Deprecated members of namespace types.
  - Namespace deal_II_numbers.
  - MultithreadInfo::n_default_threads.
  - Table::data.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/lac/</code>:</em>
  - The deprecated constructors of SparseMIC,
    SparseILU, and SparseLUDecomposition.
  - SparseMIC::decompose and SparseILU::decompose.
  - SparseMIC::reinit and SparseLUDecomposition::reinit.
  - SparseILU::apply_decomposition.
  - SparseLUDecomposition::decompose and SparseLUDecomposition::is_decomposed.
  - The compress() functions without argument in the various vector
    classes. You should use the versions with a VectorOperation
    argument instead.
  - Vector::scale.
  - TrilinosWrappers::*Vector*::compress with an Epetra_CombineMode
    argument.
  - SparsityPattern and ChunkSparsityPattern functions that take an
    <code>optimize_diagonal</code> argument.
  - SparsityPattern::partition.
  - SparsityPattern::get_rowstart_indices and
    SparsityPattern::get_column_numbers.
  - SparsityPattern::row_iterator and corresponding row_begin() and row_end()
    functions.
  - CompressedSparsityPattern::row_iterator and corresponding row_begin()
    and row_end() functions.
  - The typedef CompressedBlockSparsityPattern.
  - The deprecated constructors of SparsityPattern iterator classes.
  - The deprecated variants of DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints.
  - BlockMatrixArray and BlockTrianglePreconditioner functions that
    take an explicit VectorMemory object.
  - The SolverSelector constructor that takes a VectorMemory argument.
  - The version of parallel::distributed::Vector::compress_finish
    function that takes a boolean as argument.
  - The version of BlockVector::scale and
    parallel::distributed::Vector::scale,
    parallel::distributed::BlockVector::scale
    function that takes a scalar as argument.
  - PreconditionBlock::size.
  - Classes PreconditionedMatrix and PreconditionLACSolver.
  - PETScWrappers::VectorBase::update_ghost_values.
  - PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector constructors and reinit variants.
  - SparseMatrixIterators::Accessor and SparseMatrixIterators::Iterator
    constructors.
  - SparseMatrix::raw_entry and SparseMatrix::global_entry.
  - The ConstraintMatrix functions that transform a matrix, vector, or
    linear system into a smaller by not just setting the corresponding
    rows and columns to zero, but actually shrinking the size of the
    linear system.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/deal.II/</code>:</em>
  - GridGenerator::laplace_transformation.
  - The version of GridGenerator::parallelogram where the corners are given
    as a rank-2 tensor rather than as an array of points.
  - GridTools::create_union_triangulation.
  - GridTools::extract_boundary_mesh.
  - Triangulation::distort_random.
  - Triangulation::clear_user_pointers.
  - The refinement listener concept of the Triangulation class. This
    approach to getting notified about what happens to triangulations
    has been superseded by the signals defined by the triangulation
    class.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/fe/</code>:</em>
  - In FEValues and related classes, the functions that contain the
    term <code>2nd_derivatives</code> were removed in favor of those
    with names containing <code>hessian</code>. Similarly, functions
    with names including <code>function_grads</code> were removed in
    favor of those called <code>function_gradients</code>. Finally,
    the <code>cell_normal_vector</code> functions were replaced by
    <code>normal_vector</code> ones. In all cases, the new functions
    have been around for a while.
  - Mapping::transform_covariant and Mapping::transform_contravariant.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/dofs/</code>:</em>
  - DoFRenumbering::downstream_dg.
  - DoFTools::count_dofs_per_component.
  - DoFTools::make_sparsity_pattern with a vector-of-vector mask.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/multigrid/</code>:</em>
  - The constructors of classes MGSmoother, MGSmootherRelaxation and
    MGSmootherPrecondition that take a VectorMemory object.
  - MGLevelObject::get_minlevel and MGLevelObject::get_maxlevel.
  - MGConstrainedDoFs::non_refinement_edge_index
  - MGConstrainedDoFs::at_refinement_edge_boundary
  - MGTools::count_dofs_per_component.
  - MGTools::apply_boundary_values.
  - MGTools::extract_inner_interface_dofs.
  - Class MGMatrix.
  - Multigrid::vmult and friends.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/matrix_free/</code>:</em>
  - Classes FEEvaluationDGP, FEEvaluationGeneral and FEEvaluationGL.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/mesh_worker/</code>:</em>
  - Deprecated variants of MeshWorker::loop and MeshWorker::integration_loop.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/algorithm/</code>:</em>
  - Algorithms::ThetaTimestepping::operator().
  - Algorithms::ThetaTimestepping::initialize.
  - Algorithms::Newton::initialize.

  <br>
  <em>With headers in <code>deal.II/numerics/</code>:</em>
  - TimeDependent::end_sweep (with an argument).
  - PointValueHistory::mark_locations.
  - The DataPostprocessor::compute_derived_quantities_scalar and
    DataPostprocessor::compute_derived_quantities_vector functions without
    evaluation points. If you have
    data postprocessor classes implemented in your program that overload these
    functions, you will have to change it in a way that they overload the
    functions of same name but with the evaluation point argument instead.
  <br>
  This release also removes the deprecated class MGDoFHandler. The
  functionality of this class had previously been incorporated into
  the DoFHandler class. Unlike the changes above, if you were still
  using this class, you will need to do the following changes to
  your code:
  - Where you called <code>mg_dof_handler.distribute_dofs()</code>
    you now also need to explicitly call
    <code>mg_dof_handler.distribute_mg_dofs()</code>.
  - If you called <code>mg_dof_handler.begin(level)</code>, you
    will now have to write this as
    <code>mg_dof_handler.begin_mg(level)</code> to make clear that
    you are not just interested in an iterator to a cell on a given
    level, but in fact to a cell that can access the degrees of
    freedom on a particular level of a multigrid hierarchy.
  - The type previously referred to as
    <code>MGDoFHandler::cell_iterator</code> now corresponds to
    <code>MGDoFHandler::level_cell_iterator</code>.
  - Where you previously called DoFRenumbering::component_wise
    for the entire MGDoFHandler object, you now need to call
    this function for the DoFHandler object, and then call the
    same function with the <code>level</code> argument for each
    of the levels of the triangulation individually.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/29-2015/01/22)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The config.h file no longer exports HAVE_* definitions.
  Those are either entirely removed (for the blas/lapack symbols) or
  renamed to DEAL_II_HAVE_*. This change is done in order to avoid clashes
  with external projects also exporting HAVE_* definitions in their header
  files.

<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>


<ol>
  <li> New: IndexSet now can be constructed using Epetra_Map.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/07/25)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added the class Functions::Polynomial for representation of polynomials.
  The new class is derived from the Function class.
  <br>
  (Angel Rodriguez, 2015/07/01)
  </li>

  <li> New: deal.II now supports compilation in C++14 mode, which may be
  enabled with the CMake option <code>DEAL_II_WITH_CXX14</code>.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/06/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: Implement a modified version of the Kelly error estimator, which
  effectively provides the boundary residual term for the hp-FEM error estimators.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/06/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: DerivativeForm() now takes an additional optional
  template argument specifying the type, similarly to Tensor() classes.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/05/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: Utilities::MPI::min() functions.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/05/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: A PackagedOperation class that stores computation expressions.
  The primary purpose of this class is to provide syntactic sugar for vector
  operations (vector space addition, scalar multiplication, application of a
  linear operator) while avoiding intermediate storage.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/05/10)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Utilities::generate_normal_random_number() will now
  produce a deterministic sequence of numbers on every thread.
  Furthermore, it will also work on systems that do not have the
  <code>rand_r</code> library function, such as Cygwin.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: A LinearOperator class that stores the abstract concept of a
  linear operator. The class is fully compatible with the solver and
  preconditioner interfaces. The primary purpose of this class is to
  provide syntactic sugar for complex matrix-vector operations and free the
  user from having to create, set up and handle intermediate storage
  locations by hand.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/04/08)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: There were a number of places in the library where we unconditionally
  called functions <code>_mm_malloc()/_mm_free()</code> to allocate and free
  memory with a known alignment. This function, however, is only available on
  systems with x86 or x64_64 compatible processors. These places have now been
  replaced by calling <code>posix_memalign()</code> instead, a function that
  should be more widely available.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/15)
  </li>

  <li> Deprecated: The library uses functions such as CellAccessor::subdomain_id(),
  TriaAccessor::manifold_id(), etc, but used the deviant spelling
  TriaAccessor::boundary_indicator(), TriaAccessor::set_boundary_indicator(),
  TriaAccessor::set_all_boundary_indicators(). These last three functions are now
  deprecated and have been replaced by TriaAccessor::boundary_id(),
  TriaAccessor::set_boundary_id(), and TriaAccessor::set_all_boundary_ids() for
  consistency. Similar, Triangulation::get_boundary_indicators() has been
  deprecated in favor of Triangulation::get_boundary_ids().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/11)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All example programs used to have calls to set_boundary()
  methods to deal with curved boundaries. These have been replaced with
  the corresponding set_manifold() equivalent.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/04/06)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new flag no_automatic_repartitioning in
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation will disable the automatic
  repartitioning when calling execute_coarsening_and_refinement() (or things
  like refine_global(), ...), resulting in all cells staying on the processor
  they were before. The new function repartition() will execute the
  repartitioning as done automatically before.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/03/22)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All (Block)Compressed*SparsityPattern classes got
  replaced by DynamicSparsityPattern and
  BlockDynamicSparsityPattern, respectively and all examples now
  teach the dynamic way of creating dynamic sparsity patterns.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/03/22)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: We have traditionally had a large number of exceptions
  that did not output any useful error message other than the name
  of the exception class. This name was suggestive of the error that
  had happened, but did not convey a sufficient amount of information
  to what happened in many of the places where these kinds of exceptions
  were used, nor what may have caused the exception, or how it could
  be avoided. We have gone through many of these places and changed
  the exception to be much more verbose in what they state about the
  problem, its origin, and how it may be solved.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/28-2015/03/31)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: We have traditionally used Point@<dim@> to represent points
  in physical space, i.e., vectors that are anchored at the origin, whereas
  for vectors anchored elsewhere (e.g., differences between points, normal
  vectors, gradients, etc) we have used Tensor@<1,dim@>. This has now be
  made more formal in the documentation but also in the return types of
  <code>operator-()</code> for Point objects: The difference between two
  points, <code>p1-p2</code> now returns a Tensor@<1,dim@>. On the other
  hand, subtracting a Tensor@<1,dim@> object from a Point, <code>p-t</code>,
  results in a Point@<dim@>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: Examples from 1 to 16 now use the Manifold interface
  instead of the old Boundary interface to describe curved boundaries
  and domains.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/15)
  </li>

  <li> New: The build system now queries for git branch name and
  revision sha1 (and automatically reconfigures if necessary). This
  information is used to annotate summary.log and detailed.log with the
  current revision sha1. Further, a header file <deal.II/base/revision.h>
  is now available that exports the macros: DEAL_II_GIT_BRANCH,
  DEAL_II_GIT_REVISION, DEAL_II_GIT_REVISION_SHORT.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/02)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>



<ol>
  <li> New: VectorTools::get_position_vector now works with arbitrary
  FESystems, provided that the geometrical components are primitive, 
  and that you provide a component mask to select what components of 
  the finite element to use for the geometrical interpolation.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/07/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::refine_and_coarsen_fixed_fraction()
  in rare circumstances decided to not refine any cells at all, even
  if the refinement threshold was nonzero. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Andrea Bonito, 2015/07/24)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Bug in DynamicSparsityPattern::iterator would cause invalid
  stl::vector::iterator comparison.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/22)
  </li>

  <li>New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::add_periodicity
  now allows for arbitrary orientations between matching faces.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2015/07/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: Utilities::trim() function removes trailing and leading spaces.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/11)
  </li>

  <li>Changed: The IsBlockMatrix class is now declared in
  <code>constraint_matrix.h</code> instead of its former home in
  <code>block_indices.h</code>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/10)
  </li>

  <li>New: CellId::to_string() returns a string representation of a CellId object.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/05)
  </li>

  <li>New: Utilities::replace_in_string().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/05)
  </li>

  <li>Improved: GridOut::write_vtk() and GridOut::write_vtu() now
  output material id, level and subdomain ids of the cells.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2015/07/05)
  </li>

  <li>Improved: The font scaling in GridOut::write_svg() was broken,
  since the units were missing. It has been fixed and an additional
  parameter GridOutFlags::Svg::cell_font_scaling has been introduced
  for tuning.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2015/07/04)
  </li>

  <li> New: VectorizedArray now provides two methods
  vectorized_load_and_transpose() and vectorized_transpose_and_store() that
  perform vectorized reads or writes and convert from array-of-struct into
  struct-of-array or the other way around.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/07/02)
  </li>

  <li>New: GridGenerator::cheese() for a mesh with many holes;
  GridGenerator::simplex() for simplices in 2 and 3 dimensions;
  GridGenerator::hyper_cross() for crosses in 2 and 3 dimensions.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2015/07/02)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The specialization of DoFAccessor for zero-dimensional objects,
  i.e., for vertices as created by accessing the faces of one-dimensional
  cells, had a member function DoFAccessor::child() that was declared but not
  implemented. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth,  2015/07/01)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Functions::Monomial::gradient function now works when both base and exponent
  are equal to zero for one or more components of the monomial.
  Also, an assertion is added to avoid exponentiation of negative base numbers with real exponents.
  <br>
  (Angel Rodriguez,  2015/06/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The function numbers::is_finite() produced incorrect results when
  called with a NaN number (specifically, it produces an uncatchable floating
  point exception when called with a signaling NaN). This was clearly not
  intended since such values are definitely not finite.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/06/29)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The SparseMatrix class can now also use <code>std::complex</code>
  scalars for its elements.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/06/26)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: FE_DGQArbitraryNodes::get_name() now also detects if
  the quadrature rule was Gauss points.
  <br>
  (Guido Kanschat, 2015/06/22)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: DoFRenumbering::Cuthill_McKee() can now also
  use starting indices for parallel triangulations.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/06/11)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: VectorTools::interpolate now works with FE_Nothing.
  <br>
  (Angel Rodriguez, 2015/06/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: deal.II now uses a variety of strategies to silence compiler
  warnings about unused variables and unused parameters.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/04/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: Add a clear function to the PETSc::Vector
  and PETSc::MPI::Vector classes similar to the Trilinos vector classes.
  <br>
  (Martin Steigemann 2015/05/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: Three new quadrature formulas in quadrature_lib, based on
  Chebyshev quadrature rules. See functions QGaussChebyshev,
  QGaussRadauChebyshev and QGaussLobattoChebyshev.
  <br>
  (Giuseppe Pitton, Luca Heltai 2015/05/11)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: MatrixOut now also works with Trilinos and PETSc matrices.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/05/11)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: TrilinosWrappers::Vector, TrilinosWrappers::BlockVector,
  PETScWrappers::Vector, and PETScWrappers::BlockVector are deprecated. Either
  use the MPI or the deal.II version of the Vector/BlockVector.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, 2015/05/04)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::half_hyper_shell can now be colorized.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2015/05/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: The function VectorTools::point_gradient has been added to compute
  the gradient of a given FE function.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2015/05/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: dealii:Vector, dealii::BlockVector,
  TrilinosWrappers::MPI::Vector, TrilinosWrappers::MPI::BlockVector,
  PETScWrappers::MPI::Vector and PETScWrappers::MPI::BlockVector now have
  move constructors and move assignment operators in C++11 mode.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/05/01)
  </li>

  <li> New: Introduce DoFRenumbering::block_wise for multigrid computation.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Florian Sonner, 2015/04/30)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now MPI sum functions for Tensors and SymmetricTensors
  in the Utilities::MPI namespace.
  <br>
  (Ian Rose, 2015/04/24)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: project_boundary_values_curl_conforming_l2() produced incorrect
  results for non-uniform grids in 2D. Adjustment to the way 2D tangents to edges are
  computed fixes this.
  <br>
  (Ross Kynch, 2015/04/23)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The TimerOutput class reported abnormally large cpu time when run
  with more than one process with MPI. Now this is fixed.
  <br>
  (Lei Qiao, 2015/04/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: The VectorTools::integrate_difference() function can now
  also compute the $H_\text{div}$ seminorm, using the
  VectorTools::NormType::Hdiv_seminorm argument.
  <br>
  (Zhen Tao, Arezou Ghesmati, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/17)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The class SymmetricTensor<2,dim> is now usable also for dim>3.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/04/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: The DynamicSparsityPattern class (formerly called
  CompressedSparsityPattern) now has an iterator class that allows to
  walk over the nonzero elements of a matrix represented by this class.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: The GridGenerator::subdivided_hyper_cube() and
  GridGenerator::subdivided_hyper_rectangle() now work also for codimension
  one and two Triangulation;
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/04/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new VectorTools::get_position_vector() function has been
  added to the library that allows one to interpolate the Geometry of
  a (possibly curved) triangulation to vector finite element fields
  of at least spacedim components.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/04/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix now has member functions
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix::domain_paritioner() and
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix::range_partitioner() that return a
  vector of the underlying block Epetra_Map.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/04/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new MappingFEField() class has been added to the library
  that generalizes MappingQEulerian to allow arbitrary FiniteElements.
  <br>
  (Marco Tezzele, Luca Heltai, 2015/04/06)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The cells of coarse meshes in
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation used to be ordered in a Cuthill-McKee
  numbering, which yields very high surface-to-volume ratios of the individual
  processors' partition in case the coarse mesh consists of many cells, in
  particular in 3D. The algorithm now uses SparsityTools::reorder_hierarchical
  in order to get more compact partitions, similarly to the z-ordering applied
  by p4est.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new method
  GridTools::get_vertex_connectivity_of_cells.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new method SparsityTools::reorder_hierarchical to
  sort nodes of a graph (sparsity pattern) in a z-like way by hierarchical
  grouping of neighboring nodes.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The methods SparsityTools::reorder_Cuthill_McKee and
  GridTools::get_face_connectivity_of_cells used to take a SparsityPattern as
  argument. The data type has been changed to DynamicSparsityPattern in order
  to avoid copying things around. The old interface is still available but
  marked as deprecated.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> New: One can now ask a cell the how many-th active cell it is,
  using CellAccessor::active_cell_index() (which is called as
  <code>cell-@>active_cell_index()</code>).
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Added missing hp-related functions to FE_Q_Hierarchical together with
  a couple of unit tests. Improved code comments.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/04/10)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: deal.II did not compile on 32-bit systems when using newer
  p4est versions (1.0 and later) due to a type mismatch. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/08)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: In the spirit of the changes made to the distinction
  between Point and Tensor objects discussed above, the first argument
  to GridTools::shift() has been changed from a Point to a Tensor@<1,dim@>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/04/02)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new quadrature formula in quadrature_lib. It is
  now possible to use Telles' quadrature rules through the function QTelles
  to integrate singular integrals
  <br>
  (Nicola Giuliani, 2015/04/01)
  </li>

  <li> New: Added FE_Bernstein: a scalar finite element based on Bernstein basis polynomials.
  <br>
  (Marco Tezzele, Luca Heltai, 2015/03/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: A function to get a map with all vertices at boundaries has
  been added at GridTools::get_all_vertices_at_boundary(). This function
  will return a map which can be used in functions like
  GridTools::laplace_transform().
  <br>
  (Fernando Posada, 2015/03/31)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix::local_range() erroneously
  threw an exception in 64-bit mode. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/24)
  </li>

  <li> New: The GridOut::write_gnuplot() function produced output
  for 1d meshes embedded in higher dimensional spaces that was
  invalid in that the lines showing individual cells were connected.
  While this is not wrong for singly connected 1d meshes, it leads to wrong
  results if the domain is not singly connected and not every cell is the
  right neighbor of the previous cell.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/23)
  </li>

  <li> New: The various file format writers of class GridOut were not
  instantiated for 1d meshes in 3d space. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/23)
  </li>

  <li> New: ParameterHandler::declare_alias() allows to define
  alternate names for parameters. This is primarily intended to allow
  for backward compatible ways of changing the names of parameters
  to applications.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridGenerator::create_triangulation_with_removed_cells() creates
  a new mesh out of an existing one by dropping individual cells.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: Add MueLu preconditioner from Trilinos through the class
  TrilinosWrappers::PreconditionAMGMueLu. This is a new algebraic
  multigrid package. The input parameters are almost the same as the ones
  from ML so that the two preconditioners can be easily swapped.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, 2015/03/11)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Iterating over the elements of a TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix
  object previously led to errors if the matrix was in fact stored in
  parallel across multiple MPI processes. This is now fixed: rows not
  stored locally on the processor where you run the iteration simply look
  like they're empty.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/03/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new macro DeclExceptionMsg that allows to
  declare an exception that does not take any run-time arguments
  yet still allows to specify an error message.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a class std_cxx11::unique_ptr that provides
  the functionality of std::unique_ptr in C++11 mode, and that
  provides an emulation for older compilers.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: IndexSet now has a local typedef IndexSet::value_type.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_TraceQ can now also be used in 1D.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/02/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_TraceQ now implements get_face_interpolation_matrix and
  get_subface_interpolation_matrix, enabling
  DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints on this element.
  <br>
  (Anton Evgrafov, 2015/02/21)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: MappingQEulerian would previously not move interior points
  in 1D for higher order mappings. This has been fixed by removing a few
  specializations of MappingQ for 1D that are no longer necessary.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/02/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The implementation of the class GrowingVectorMemory has been
  moved from source/lac/vector_memory.cc to the new file
  include/deal.II/lac/vector_memory.templates.h. This allows users to
  create instantiations of GrowingVectorMemory for their own vector classes
  in case they intend to use them for the deal.II solvers.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/02/18)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All members of MultithreadInfo are now static so it is no
  longer necessary to use the global instance multithread_info (now
  deprecated) or create your own instance (which does not work correctly
  anyway).
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/02/13)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: There was a bug in the energy source term of step-33 whereby
  the term was erroneously multiplied by the density. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Praveen C, Lei Qiao, 2015/02/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: If you take the product of a Tensor and a scalar number,
  you previously got a Tensor back that stored its elements in the same
  data type as the original tensor. This leads to problems if you
  multiply a <code>Tensor@<1,dim,double@></code> by a
  <code>std::complex@<double@></code> because the result clearly needs
  to store its elements as complex numbers, rather than as double
  variables. This is now changed: The result of the product of a Tensor
  and a scalar number is now a Tensor that stores its elements in a data
  type appropriate for this product. The same approach is taken for the
  SymmetricTensor class.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a new class ProductType that can be used
  to infer the type of the product of two objects. There is now also
  a class EnableIfScalar that helps restrict some templates to only
  cases where a type is a scalar.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/02/04)
  </li>

  <li> New: The Tensor classes now have copy constructors and copy
  operators that allow assignment from other tensors with different
  underlying scalar types.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/02/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: Class hp::DoFHandler can now also be serialized.
  <br>
  (Lukas Korous, 2015/01/31)
  </li>

  <li> Bugfix: deal.II now correctly links against librt in case of bundled
  boost being used.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: A new macro <code>DEAL_II_QUERY_GIT_INFORMATION</code> is
  provided to query user projects for git repository information simmilarly
  to those exported by deal.II.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/01/21)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues did not fill the
  jacobians and inverse jacobians if requested via the update flags.
  This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/23)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: ParameterHandler::read_input() now checks that
  'subsection'/'end' are balanced in the input.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: In 3d, when you set the <code>colorize</code> flag of
  GridGenerator::hyper_shell(), the faces of the domain were colored but
  the edges were not. This was an oversight because to refine correctly,
  the edges also have to have the appropriate boundary indicator set.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/01/16)
  </li>

  <li> New: dealii::multithread_info.n_cpus returns the correct number of CPU
  on FreeBSD.
  <br>
  (Bruno Turcksin, 2015/01/14)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: MPI collective operations such as MPI::sum, MPI::max now
  check for job_supports_mpi() internally, which allows running them also
  without a call to MPI_Init.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The method job_supports_mpi() now resides in the namespace
  Utilities::MPI instead of Utilities::System for consistency with other MPI
  methods. The old method has been marked deprecated and will be removed in
  a future version.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The update of ghost values in parallel::distributed::Vector when
  calling the assignment operator is now active when one of the two vector had
  its ghost values updated before or when the layout of the right hand side
  vector is one-to-one, more consistent with parallel PETSc and Trilinos
  vectors.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/01/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: PETScWrappers::MPI::SparseMatrix::reinit(other) copies
  the layout of another matrix. TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix
  operator= and copy constructor are now disabled. This brings
  functionality between PETSc and Trilinos in line.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids() and
  Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids_on_boundaries()
  set all manifold ids on every object or on every
  boundary object respectively.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridTools::copy_boundary_to_manifold_id() and
  GridTools::copy_material_to_manifold_id() copy
  boundary_ids and material_ids to manifold_ids for
  faces on the boundary and for cells respectively.
  <br>
  (Luca Heltai, 2015/01/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Utilities::int_to_string() produced wrong results if
  the number of digits specified was ten or greater.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/01/08)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::interpolate_to_different_mesh() was accidentally
  only instantiated for dealii::Vector arguments, rather than all vector
  classes. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Benjamin Brands, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Use CASROOT environment variable as additional hint for
  opencasacade.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Update the run_testsuite.cmake script to also pick up
  muparser and opencascade configuration.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Update several places in the documentation that were not
  updated from functionparser to muparser. Add several forgotten
  DEAL_II_WITH_* variables to certain places in the documentation.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2014/12/29)

<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Changed: deallog console depth is now 0 by default, causing no
  output to the screen from solvers and other places in the library.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/12/06)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function Utilities::trim() now removes general
  white space characters, such as '<tt>\\r</tt>' and '<tt>\\n</tt>', as well as
  space characters.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/12/05)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The previously deprecated global instance multithread_info of
  MultithreadInfo has been removed (all members of this class are static
  so there is no reason to use/create an instance). The deprecated
  MultithreadInfo::n_cpus member also got removed in favor of
  MultithreadInfo::n_cores().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/11/19)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The <code>UpdateFlags</code> flags
  <code>update_support_points</code>, <code>update_support_jacobians</code>,
  and <code>update_support_inverse_jacobians</code> have been removed.
  <code>update_support_points</code> was deprecated in 2013 and has not done
  anything in a long time. The
  other two appeared in 2007 and were never implemented.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/09/16)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The two argument variant of cross_product() that returned
  the result by reference as first argument has been removed. Use the
  function cross_product_2d(), or cross_product_3d(), that directly returns
  the result instead. Further, the exception
  Tensor<rank,dim,Number>::ExcInvalidTensorContractionIndex has been
  removed
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/14 - 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The following functions in tensor.h have been deprecated:
  <br>
  - double_contract(). Use the generic contraction function
    contract() instead.
  - The four and five argument variants of contract() that return the
    result by reference as first argument and take the contraction indices as
    arguments. use the generic contraction function contract() instead.
  - The three argument variants of contract() that return the result by
    reference as first argument. Use <code>operator*</code> instead.
  - The three argument variant of cross_product() that returns the result
    by reference as first argument. Use the cross_product() function that
    directly returns the result instead.
  - The three argument variants of <code>outer_product</code> that return
    the result by reference as first argument. Use the function that
    directly returns the result instead.
  - determinant(dealii::Tensor<rank,1,Number>)
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/14 - 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The Tensor and Point classes no
  longer have a constructor taking a boolean argument. Those were replaced
  by a default constructor that will always initialize underlying values with
  zero.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/07)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The testsuite no longer supports compiler constraints of
  the form "<code>.compiler=[NAME]...</code>".
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The parameter @p first_vector_components has been removed
  from GridTools::collect_periodic_faces(). Instead,
  DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints() now accepts a parameter
  @p first_vector_components in all (supported) variants.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: FEValues::normal_vector() for historical reasons returned a
  value of type Point, though a normal vector is more adequately described
  as a Tensor@<1,dim@>. Many similar cases were already clarified in deal.II
  8.3. The current case has now also been changed: FEValues::normal_vector()
  now returns a Tensor, rather than a Point.
  <br>
  In a similar spirit, the FEValues::get_normal_vectors() function that
  still returns a vector of Points has been deprecated and a new function,
  FEValues::get_all_normal_vectors(), that returns a vector of tensors,
  has been added. This was necessary since there is no way to change the
  return type of the existing function in a backward compatible way. The
  old function will be removed in the next version, and the new function
  will then be renamed to the old name.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The mesh_converter program has been removed from the
  contrib folder. The equivalent functionality can now be found in
  the GridIn class.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The signature of the FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(),
  FiniteElement::fill_fe_face_values(), and FiniteElement::fill_fe_subface_values()
  functions has been changed, in an effort to clarify which of these contain
  input information and which contain output information for these functions.
  The same has been done for the corresponding functions in the Mapping
  class hierarchy. As part of a general overhaul, the FEValuesData class
  has also been removed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/20-2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functions update_once() and update_each() in the
  Mapping classes computed information that was, in essence, only of use
  internally. No external piece of code actually needed to know which
  pieces of information a mapping could compute once and which they needed
  to compute on every cell. Consequently, these two functions have been
  removed and have been replaced by Mapping::requires_update_flags().
  <br>
  A similar change has been applied to the FiniteElement class.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/20-2015/12/01)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function DoFRenumbering::random() now produces different
  numberings than it did before, but in return has now acquired the property
  that its results are predictable and repeatable.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/21)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>
<ol>
  <li> New: There is now much more documentation for the FiniteElement class,
  in particular detailing what one needs to implement when writing finite
  element descriptions in derived classes.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function template numbers::signaling_nan() that
  is used to create invalid floating point objects. These objects can either
  be scalars, or of type Tensor, SymmetricTensor, or DerivativeForm. The
  content of these objects is a "signaling NaN" ("NaN" stands for "not a
  number", and "signaling" implies that at least on platforms where this
  is supported, any arithmetic operation using them terminates the program).
  The purpose of this is to use them as markers for uninitialized objects
  and arrays that are required to be filled in other places, and to trigger
  an error when this later initialization does not happen before the first
  use.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Timo Heister, 2015/11/24)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function FE_DGPNonparametric::shape_value() and similar
  functions in the same class returned values and derivatives of shape
  functions on the reference cell. However, this element is not defined
  through mapping of shape functions from the reference cell, and consequently
  it makes no sense to ask for this information. These functions have therefore
  been changed to throw an exception instead, as documented in
  FiniteElement::shape_value().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Trilinos ML preconditioner is now deterministic when using
  version 12.4 or newer.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/11/16)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functionality to distribute cells across processes
  according to a vector of cell weights that was passed in a call to
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition()
  was replaced by a cell-wise signal. This signal is called during
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement() and
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition()
  if any function is connected to it. It allows to connect a function that
  takes the current cell iterator and a status argument that indicates whether
  this cell will be refined, coarsened or remains unchanged and returns a
  cell weight, which will be used to distribute cells across processes in a
  way that keeps the sum of weights across each individual process
  approximately equal.
  <br>
  (Rene Gassmoeller, 2015/11/02)
  </li>

  <li> New: 2nd derivatives are implemented for PolynomialsBDM in 3D.
  <br>
  (Alistair Bentley, 2015/10/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: Preliminary support for parallel, adaptive, geometric multigrid is
  now in place with changes to MGConstrainedDoFs (many new functions), MGTransfer,
  MGTools::extract_inner_interface_dofs, MGTransferPrebuilt,
  DoFTools::extract_locally_relevant_level_dofs.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Guido Kanschat, 2015/10/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: Two cell level signals are added to class Triangulation, namely
  pre_coarsening_on_cell and post_refinement_on_cell.
  <br>
  (Lei Qiao, 2015/10/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::ghost_owners()
  returns the set of MPI ranks of the ghost cells. Similarly
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::level_ghost_owners() for level
  ghosts.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/30)
  </li>

  <li> New: FunctionParser now supports <code>pow(a,b)</code>.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/30)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The interfaces to all deal.II type solvers and
  preconditioners have been updated such that they function as expected
  with the LinearOperator class and its associated functions (i.e.,
  linear_operator(), transpose_operator() and inverse_operator()).
  These preconditioners can now be wrapped as a LinearOperator,
  facilitating the construction of approximate matrix inverses such as in
  the development of a block matrix preconditioner. An example of this
  functionality can be found in
  <code>tests/lac/linear_operator_08.cc</code>.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/09/24 - 2015/10/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: MGTransferPrebuilt can now be used with parallel::distributed::Vector
  and TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix as a transfer matrix.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Vector is now fully functional for
  indices larger than 4 billion.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: PArpackSolver eigensolver interface class.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All doxygen-generated pages now contain a link to the
  tutorial in their top-level menus.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/13)
  </li>

  <li>New: A new namespace TensorAccessors is introduced that contains
  generic algorithms for tensorial objects, i.e., objects that allow
  repeated access via the index operator <code>operator[](unsigned int)</code>.
  The methods in TensorAccessors is primarily meant to replace old internal
  code in <code>tensor.h</code>, but it might also proof useful otherwise.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: A python script (including instructions) for enabling pretty
  printing with GDB is now available in
  <tt>/contrib/utilities/dotgdbinit.py</tt>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, David Wells, 2015/09/11)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: When available, deal.II now uses the "gold" linker, a
  reimplementation of the traditional Unix "ld" linker that is substantially
  faster. This reduces build and, in particular, test turnaround times.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Matthias Maier, 2015/09/06)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Allow continuation lines in ParameterHandler.
  <br>
  (Alberto Sartori, 2015/09/04)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The interface of Tensor<rank,dim,Number> has been cleaned
  up (a lot of unnecessary partial template specializations have been
  removed). The specialization Tensor<1,dim,Number> has been removed.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::integrate_difference() for VectorTools::Hdiv_seminorm
  was computed incorrectly.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The testsuite now supports multiple comparison files.
  Apart from the main comparison file that ends in
  <code>[...].output</code> all files of the form
  <code>[...].output.[string]</code> are considered for comparison.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: A class BlockLinearOperator has been introduced that extends
  the LinearOperator concept to block structures. A BlockLinearOperator can
  be sliced back to a LinearOperator.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/27)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Support for complex number types throughout the library.
  Several parts of the library have been reorganized to support complex
  number types.
  <br>
  <em>Classes that are now instantiated for complex number types:</em>
  - FunctionTime
  - Function
  - TensorFunction
  <br>
  <em>Classes with fixed interface that now fully support complex number
  types (pure template classes without explicit instantiations in the
  library):</em>
  - LinearOperator
  - PackagedOperation
  - Tensor
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The testsuite now properly supports version constraints for
  features. Those are annotated by
  <code>.with_FEATURE(&lt;=|&gt;=|=|&lt;|&gt;)VERSION.</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The GridIn class was not instantiated for the
  <code>dim==1,spacedim==3</code> case. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: In 1d, GridIn::read_msh() ignored boundary indicators
  associated with vertices. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Jan Stebel, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The interface and documentation for periodic boundary
  conditions have been restructured. A
  @ref GlossPeriodicConstraints "glossary entry" has been written.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, Matthias Maier, 2015/08/01-2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is a new documentation module on
  @ref FE_vs_Mapping_vs_FEValues "How Mapping, FiniteElement, and FEValues work together".
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> New: parallel::shared::Triangulation class which extends
  Triangulation class to automatically partition triangulation when run
  with MPI. Common functionality between parallel::shared::Triangulation and
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation is implemented in the parent class
  parallel::Triangulation.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/08/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: The online documentation of all functions now includes
  links to the file and line where that function is implemented. Both
  are clickable to provide immediate access to the source code of a
  function.
  <br>
  (Jason Sheldon, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: The InterpolatedTensorProductGridData::gradient() function
  is now implemented.
  <br>
  (Daniel Shapero, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_RannacherTurek describes a discontinuous FiniteElement
  with vanishing mean values of jumps across faces.
  <br>
  (Patrick Esser, 2015/08/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_Q_Bubbles describes a FiniteElement based on FE_Q
  enriched by bubble functions.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: The testsuite now runs in a mode in which we abort programs for
  floating point exceptions due to divisions by zero or other invalid arithmetic.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() can now be called more than
  once and the environment variable DEAL_II_NUM_THREADS will be respected
  even if user code never calls it.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: IndexSet now implements iterators.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/12)
  </li>

</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>



<ol>
  <li> Improved: The method
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::fill_vertices_with_ghost_neighbors()
  that is used for distributing DoFs on parallel triangulations previously
  exhibited quadratic complexity in the number of coarse grid cells. This has
  been changed into linear complexity calls (apart from a few issues
  inside p4est).
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/12/05)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The constructor of SymmetricTensor that takes an array
  of initializing elements led to a compiler error. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/28)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Vector now detects if the size of MPI
  messages exceeds 2GB or if the local range exceeds the size of 32-bit
  integers and throws an exception informing about the unsupported sizes.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/11/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: In 3d, GridGenerator::extract_boundary_mesh() now copies the
  manifold ids of edges of the volume mesh to the manifold ids of the edges
  of the extracted surface mesh.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::create_triangulation() now accepts subcell-data
  objects that may include information about interior edges and faces, to
  facilitate setting manifold indicators on interior edges and faces.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::extract_boundary_mesh() in 3d could generate
  surface cells that did not uniformly had a right- or left-handed coordinate
  system associated with them when viewed from one side of the surface. This
  has been fixed: they now all have a right-handed coordinate system when seen
  from one side of the surface, and a left-handed one when viewed from the
  other side.
  <br>
  (Daniel Weygand, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: Extra parameters to GD and Lanczos SLEPc solvers. Also added unit tests.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FETools::project_dg was adding the vector projection to
  the output vector. Now is the output vector initialized to zero.
  <br>
  (Adam Kosik, 2015/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: A compilation issue with DEAL_II_INCLUDE_DIRS not used for
  compiling bundled boost.
  <br>
  (Lukas Korous, 2015/11/01)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: PolynomialsBDM::degree() now returns the correct value.
  <br>
  (Alistair Bentley, 2015/10/24)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids_on_boundary(boundary_id, manifold_id)
  which sets the manifold_id for all parts of the boundary with a given boundary_id.
  <br>
  (Alberto Sartori, 2015/10/22)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The range vectors in the construction of an
  inverse_operator() is now reinitialised before solve calls. This ensures
  a consistent starting point for the solver.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/10/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: Ghost cells for the multigrid levels in
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation are now correctly created also for
  periodic boundary conditions.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/10/18)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::subdivided_parallelepiped() produced
  invalid, unconnected meshes and wrong boundary indicators.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/10/13)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: DoFTools::compute_intergrid_transfer_representation
  can now be used with a fine grid given by a parallel::Triangulation.
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, 2015/10/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridIn::read_unv() can now read more element codes that
  are used in typical meshes.
  <br>
  (Aslan Kosakian, 2015/10/06)
  </li>

  <li> New: DoFTools::locally_relevant_dofs_per_subdomain() can be used
  to extract an IndexSet of locally relevant DoFs for a Triangulation
  partitioned using METIS or with a parallel::shared::Triangulation .
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/09/24)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: hp::SolutionTransfer could get confused when dealing with
  FE_Nothing elements. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Claire Bruna-Rosso, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/23)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The construction of the non-local graph for quick data
  exchange of TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix became very slow for a few
  thousand processors. This has been fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Initializing a TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix from a
  DynamicSparsityPattern included some O(global_size) operations. These have
  been replaced by operations only on the local range.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All doxygen-generated pages now contain a link to the
  tutorial in their top-level menus.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/13)
  </li>

  <li>Cleanup: Constructors of AdditionalData in various linear solvers are now marked
  explicit. This avoid bugs with implicit conversions like the one fixed in step-40.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Lei Qiao, 2015/09/09)
  </li>

  <li>New: Introduced third-order derivatives of the shape functions, which
  can now be accessed through FEValues and FEValuesViews using similar interfaces
  as shape_values, shape_derivatives and shape_hessians.
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>Cleanup: TableIndices<N> can now be used (constructed and accessed)
  with N > 7.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: std::begin and std::end are now available within the std_cxx11
  namespace through <base/std_cxx11/iterator.h>
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: MappingQ1Eulerian was not instantiated for the various
  Trilinos vector types. It is now instantiated for the same
  vector types as MappingQEulerian is.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: Introduced Hessian-related functions to the Function class.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: Memory consumption during compilation has been reduced by splitting
  instantiation files. For this make_instantiations now supports additional
  logic to split the the instantiations in .inst files into groups. This is
  used in fe_values.cc, error_estimator.cc, and others.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function SparsityPattern::print_svg() which prints the sparsity of the matrix
  in a .svg file which can be opened in a web browser.
  <br>
  (Conrad Clevenger, 2015/09/03)
  </li>

  <li> Openmp SIMD support is now enabled for Clang version 3.6, or newer
  (or the equivalent XCode version). Further, openmp support is not any
  more falsely activated for very old clang versions.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints() now supports
  hp-refinement cases when neither_element_dominates. To that end we look for
  a least face dominating FE inside FECollection.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: FEValues::transform() has been deprecated. The functionality
  of this function is a (small) subset of what the Mapping classes
  already provide.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> New: introduced hp::FECollection::find_least_face_dominating_fe(const std::set<unsigned int> &fes)
  which aims to find the least dominating finite element w.r.t. those provided
  as fe_indices in @p fes.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: step-6 now has an additional subsection in the
  "Possibilities for extensions" section that discusses how
  to create a better mesh.
  <br>
  (Konstantin Ladutenko, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: Introduce an option for FE_Nothing to dominate any other FE.
  Therefore at interfaces where, for example, a Q1 meets an FE_Nothing,
  we will force the traces of the two functions to be the same. Because the
  FE_Nothing encodes a space that is zero everywhere, this means that the Q1
  field will be forced to become zero at this interface.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: Jacobian second and third derivatives are now computed by the mapping classes and can be
  accessed through FEValues in much the same way as the Jacobian and Jacobian gradient.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/28-2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now a collection of functions named GridTools::compute_active_cell_halo_layer()
  that determine which cells form a layer around a specified subdomain. There is also a function
  GridTools::compute_ghost_cell_halo_layer() that returns the smallest layer of ghost cells around
  all locally relevant cells.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Documentation: How to set up a testsuite in a user project is now
  properly documented.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/01 - 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The computation of gradients in FE_PolyTensor and its derived classes (in particular in
  FE_RaviartThomas and FE_Nedelec) forgot to account for terms that appear on non-affine
  cells. Consequently, the computed gradients did not match the actual derivatives of the values
  these elements report. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/18-2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Generalized conversion between Tensor<order+1,dim> and
  DerivativeForm<order,dim,dim> to general order using converting constructor
  and assignment operator.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/01-2015/08/09)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function Vector::ratio() and the corresponding
  functions in other vector classes have been deprecated.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Bruno Turcksin, 2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: Direct support for Abaqus mesh files has been added to the GridIn
  class through the function GridIn::read_abaqus().
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, Timo Heister,  Krzysztof Bzowski, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Finite elements now compute hessians analytically rather than
  by finite differencing.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/01-2015/08/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function Mapping::project_real_point_to_unit_point_on_face()
  that calls Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell() and then projects the
  result to a provided face.
  <br>
  (Jason Sheldon, 2015/08/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues can now also compute
  gradients of the Jacobian of the transformation from unit to real cell,
  controlled by update_jacobian_grads.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/08/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function MemoryConsumption::memory_consumption()
  for std_cxx11::unique_ptr arguments.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/07)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: CMake configuration: The DEAL_II_ADD_TEST now also
  supports unit tests writing to stdout and stderr. Further, a second test
  type consisting of an internal executable target, a configuration and a
  comparison file is now supported.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: VtkFlags now stores a parameter describing the compression level
  zlib uses when writing compressed output. For small problems, the flag
  ZlibCompressionLevel::best_speed can make the call to write_vtu many times
  faster.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/08/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The conversion Epetra_Map -> IndexSet is now an O(1)
  operation for contiguous index ranges, improving over the old O(N) behavior.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/07/30)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The initialization methods of TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix,
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix, TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern, and
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparsityPattern with Epetra_Map arguments have been
  marked as deprecated. Use the functions with IndexSet argument instead.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, Luca Heltai, 2015/07/30)
  </li>

  <li> New: FESystem now does some work in parallel if your system
  has multiple processors.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: When using FESystem with base elements that require
  information other than the determinant of the Jacobian (e.g.,
  elements that require the Jacobian itself), then this information
  was not passed down to FiniteElement::fill_fe_values of the
  base element. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Zhen Tao, 2015/07/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: The parallel::distributed::Triangulation can now be told to
  partition the cells so that the sum of certain weights associated with each
  cell, rather than the number of cells, is roughly constant between processors.
  This is done by passing a vector of weights to the function that repartitions
  the triangulation, parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: DataOutBase::TecplotFlags now takes a third argument for solution
  time which is useful to visualize transient data. If a user sets a non-negative
  time, it will be saved into the tecplot file.
  <br>
  (Praveen Chandrashekar, 2015/08/30)

<!-- ----------- INCOMPATIBILITIES ----------------- -->

<a name="incompatible"></a>
<h3 style="color:red">Incompatibilities</h3>

<p style="color:red">
Following are a few modifications to the library that unfortunately
are incompatible with previous versions of the library, but which we
deem necessary for the future maintainability of the
library. Unfortunately, some of these changes will require
modifications to application programs. We apologize for the
inconvenience this causes.
</p>

<ol>
<<<<<<< HEAD
  <li> Changed: The function Utilities::trim() now removes general
  white space characters, such as '<tt>\\r</tt>' and '<tt>\\n</tt>', as well as
  space characters.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/12/05)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The previously deprecated global instance multithread_info of
=======
  <li> Changed: deallog console depth is now 0 by default, causing no
  output to the screen from solvers and other places in the library.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/12/06)

  <li> Removed: Previously deprecated global instance multithread_info of
>>>>>>> changelog
  MultithreadInfo has been removed (all members of this class are static
  so there is no reason to use/create an instance). The deprecated
  MultithreadInfo::n_cpus member also got removed in favor of
  MultithreadInfo::n_cores().
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/11/19)

  <li> Removed: The <code>UpdateFlags</code> flags
  <code>update_support_points</code>, <code>update_support_jacobians</code>,
  and <code>update_support_inverse_jacobians</code> have been removed.
  <code>update_support_points</code> was deprecated in 2013 and has not done
  anything in a long time. The
  other two appeared in 2007 and were never implemented.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/09/16)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The two argument variant of cross_product() that returned
  the result by reference as first argument has been removed. Use the
  function cross_product_2d(), or cross_product_3d(), that directly returns
  the result instead. Further, the exception
  Tensor<rank,dim,Number>::ExcInvalidTensorContractionIndex has been
  removed
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/14 - 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The following functions in tensor.h have been deprecated:
  <br>
  - double_contract(). Use the generic contraction function
    contract() instead.
  - The four and five argument variants of contract() that return the
    result by reference as first argument and take the contraction indices as
    arguments. use the generic contraction function contract() instead.
  - The three argument variants of contract() that return the result by
    reference as first argument. Use <code>operator*</code> instead.
  - The three argument variant of cross_product() that returns the result
    by reference as first argument. Use the cross_product() function that
    directly returns the result instead.
  - The three argument variants of <code>outer_product</code> that return
    the result by reference as first argument. Use the function that
    directly returns the result instead.
  - determinant(dealii::Tensor<rank,1,Number>)
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/14 - 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The Tensor and Point classes no
  longer have a constructor taking a boolean argument. Those were replaced
  by a default constructor that will always initialize underlying values with
  zero.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/07)
  </li>

  <li> Removed: The testsuite no longer supports compiler constraints of
  the form "<code>.compiler=[NAME]...</code>".
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The parameter @p first_vector_components has been removed
  from GridTools::collect_periodic_faces(). Instead,
  DoFTools::make_periodicity_constraints() now accepts a parameter
  @p first_vector_components in all (supported) variants.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: FEValues::normal_vector() for historical reasons returned a
  value of type Point, though a normal vector is more adequately described
  as a Tensor@<1,dim@>. Many similar cases were already clarified in deal.II
  8.3. The current case has now also been changed: FEValues::normal_vector()
  now returns a Tensor, rather than a Point.
  <br>
  In a similar spirit, the FEValues::get_normal_vectors() function that
  still returns a vector of Points has been deprecated and a new function,
  FEValues::get_all_normal_vectors(), that returns a vector of tensors,
  has been added. This was necessary since there is no way to change the
  return type of the existing function in a backward compatible way. The
  old function will be removed in the next version, and the new function
  will then be renamed to the old name.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The mesh_converter program has been removed from the
  contrib folder. The equivalent functionality can now be found in
  the GridIn class.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The signature of the FiniteElement::fill_fe_values(),
  FiniteElement::fill_fe_face_values(), and FiniteElement::fill_fe_subface_values()
  functions has been changed, in an effort to clarify which of these contain
  input information and which contain output information for these functions.
  The same has been done for the corresponding functions in the Mapping
  class hierarchy. As part of a general overhaul, the FEValuesData class
  has also been removed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/20-2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functions update_once() and update_each() in the
  Mapping classes computed information that was, in essence, only of use
  internally. No external piece of code actually needed to know which
  pieces of information a mapping could compute once and which they needed
  to compute on every cell. Consequently, these two functions have been
  removed and have been replaced by Mapping::requires_update_flags().
  <br>
  A similar change has been applied to the FiniteElement class.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/20-2015/12/01)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function DoFRenumbering::random() now produces different
  numberings than it did before, but in return has now acquired the property
  that its results are predictable and repeatable.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/21)
  </li>
</ol>


<!-- ----------- GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="general"></a>
<h3>General</h3>
<ol>
  <li> New: There is now much more documentation for the FiniteElement class,
  in particular detailing what one needs to implement when writing finite
  element descriptions in derived classes.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function template numbers::signaling_nan() that
  is used to create invalid floating point objects. These objects can either
  be scalars, or of type Tensor, SymmetricTensor, or DerivativeForm. The
  content of these objects is a "signaling NaN" ("NaN" stands for "not a
  number", and "signaling" implies that at least on platforms where this
  is supported, any arithmetic operation using them terminates the program).
  The purpose of this is to use them as markers for uninitialized objects
  and arrays that are required to be filled in other places, and to trigger
  an error when this later initialization does not happen before the first
  use.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Timo Heister, 2015/11/24)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function FE_DGPNonparametric::shape_value() and similar
  functions in the same class returned values and derivatives of shape
  functions on the reference cell. However, this element is not defined
  through mapping of shape functions from the reference cell, and consequently
  it makes no sense to ask for this information. These functions have therefore
  been changed to throw an exception instead, as documented in
  FiniteElement::shape_value().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: Trilinos ML preconditioner is now deterministic when using
  version 12.4 or newer.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/11/16)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The functionality to distribute cells across processes
  according to a vector of cell weights that was passed in a call to
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition()
  was replaced by a cell-wise signal. This signal is called during
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::execute_coarsening_and_refinement() and
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition()
  if any function is connected to it. It allows to connect a function that
  takes the current cell iterator and a status argument that indicates whether
  this cell will be refined, coarsened or remains unchanged and returns a
  cell weight, which will be used to distribute cells across processes in a
  way that keeps the sum of weights across each individual process
  approximately equal.
  <br>
  (Rene Gassmoeller, 2015/11/02)
  </li>

  <li> New: 2nd derivatives are implemented for PolynomialsBDM in 3D.
  <br>
  (Alistair Bentley, 2015/10/27)
  </li>

  <li> New: Preliminary support for parallel, adaptive, geometric multigrid is
  now in place with changes to MGConstrainedDoFs (many new functions), MGTransfer,
  MGTools::extract_inner_interface_dofs, MGTransferPrebuilt,
  DoFTools::extract_locally_relevant_level_dofs.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Guido Kanschat, 2015/10/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: Two cell level signals are added to class Triangulation, namely
  pre_coarsening_on_cell and post_refinement_on_cell.
  <br>
  (Lei Qiao, 2015/10/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: parallel::distributed::Triangulation::ghost_owners()
  returns the set of MPI ranks of the ghost cells. Similarly
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::level_ghost_owners() for level
  ghosts.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/30)
  </li>

  <li> New: FunctionParser now supports <code>pow(a,b)</code>.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/30)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The interfaces to all deal.II type solvers and
  preconditioners have been updated such that they function as expected
  with the LinearOperator class and its associated functions (i.e.,
  linear_operator(), transpose_operator() and inverse_operator()).
  These preconditioners can now be wrapped as a LinearOperator,
  facilitating the construction of approximate matrix inverses such as in
  the development of a block matrix preconditioner. An example of this
  functionality can be found in
  <code>tests/lac/linear_operator_08.cc</code>.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/09/24 - 2015/10/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: MGTransferPrebuilt can now be used with parallel::distributed::Vector
  and TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix as a transfer matrix.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Vector is now fully functional for
  indices larger than 4 billion.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: PArpackSolver eigensolver interface class.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/17)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All doxygen-generated pages now contain a link to the
  tutorial in their top-level menus.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/13)
  </li>

  <li>New: A new namespace TensorAccessors is introduced that contains
  generic algorithms for tensorial objects, i.e., objects that allow
  repeated access via the index operator <code>operator[](unsigned int)</code>.
  The methods in TensorAccessors is primarily meant to replace old internal
  code in <code>tensor.h</code>, but it might also proof useful otherwise.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: A python script (including instructions) for enabling pretty
  printing with GDB is now available in
  <tt>/contrib/utilities/dotgdbinit.py</tt>.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, David Wells, 2015/09/11)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: When available, deal.II now uses the "gold" linker, a
  reimplementation of the traditional Unix "ld" linker that is substantially
  faster. This reduces build and, in particular, test turnaround times.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Matthias Maier, 2015/09/06)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Allow continuation lines in ParameterHandler.
  <br>
  (Alberto Sartori, 2015/09/04)
  </li>

  <li> Cleanup: The interface of Tensor<rank,dim,Number> has been cleaned
  up (a lot of unnecessary partial template specializations have been
  removed). The specialization Tensor<1,dim,Number> has been removed.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: VectorTools::integrate_difference() for VectorTools::Hdiv_seminorm
  was computed incorrectly.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The testsuite now supports multiple comparison files.
  Apart from the main comparison file that ends in
  <code>[...].output</code> all files of the form
  <code>[...].output.[string]</code> are considered for comparison.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: A class BlockLinearOperator has been introduced that extends
  the LinearOperator concept to block structures. A BlockLinearOperator can
  be sliced back to a LinearOperator.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/27)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Support for complex number types throughout the library.
  Several parts of the library have been reorganized to support complex
  number types.
  <br>
  <em>Classes that are now instantiated for complex number types:</em>
  - FunctionTime
  - Function
  - TensorFunction
  <br>
  <em>Classes with fixed interface that now fully support complex number
  types (pure template classes without explicit instantiations in the
  library):</em>
  - LinearOperator
  - PackagedOperation
  - Tensor
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The testsuite now properly supports version constraints for
  features. Those are annotated by
  <code>.with_FEATURE(&lt;=|&gt;=|=|&lt;|&gt;)VERSION.</code>.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The GridIn class was not instantiated for the
  <code>dim==1,spacedim==3</code> case. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: In 1d, GridIn::read_msh() ignored boundary indicators
  associated with vertices. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Jan Stebel, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/25)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The interface and documentation for periodic boundary
  conditions have been restructured. A
  @ref GlossPeriodicConstraints "glossary entry" has been written.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, Matthias Maier, 2015/08/01-2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is a new documentation module on
  @ref FE_vs_Mapping_vs_FEValues "How Mapping, FiniteElement, and FEValues work together".
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> New: parallel::shared::Triangulation class which extends
  Triangulation class to automatically partition triangulation when run
  with MPI. Common functionality between parallel::shared::Triangulation and
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation is implemented in the parent class
  parallel::Triangulation.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/08/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: The online documentation of all functions now includes
  links to the file and line where that function is implemented. Both
  are clickable to provide immediate access to the source code of a
  function.
  <br>
  (Jason Sheldon, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: The InterpolatedTensorProductGridData::gradient() function
  is now implemented.
  <br>
  (Daniel Shapero, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_RannacherTurek describes a discontinuous FiniteElement
  with vanishing mean values of jumps across faces.
  <br>
  (Patrick Esser, 2015/08/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: FE_Q_Bubbles describes a FiniteElement based on FE_Q
  enriched by bubble functions.
  <br>
  (Daniel Arndt, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> New: The testsuite now runs in a mode in which we abort programs for
  floating point exceptions due to divisions by zero or other invalid arithmetic.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/29)
  </li>

  <li> New: MultithreadInfo::set_thread_limit() can now be called more than
  once and the environment variable DEAL_II_NUM_THREADS will be respected
  even if user code never calls it.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: IndexSet now implements iterators.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/07/12)
  </li>

</ol>


<!-- ----------- SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS ----------------- -->

<a name="specific"></a>
<h3>Specific improvements</h3>



<ol>
  <li> Improved: The method
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation::fill_vertices_with_ghost_neighbors()
  that is used for distributing DoFs on parallel triangulations previously
  exhibited quadratic complexity in the number of coarse grid cells. This has
  been changed into linear complexity calls (apart from a few issues
  inside p4est).
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/12/05)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The constructor of SymmetricTensor that takes an array
  of initializing elements led to a compiler error. This is now
  fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/28)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: parallel::distributed::Vector now detects if the size of MPI
  messages exceeds 2GB or if the local range exceeds the size of 32-bit
  integers and throws an exception informing about the unsupported sizes.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/11/26)
  </li>

  <li> New: In 3d, GridGenerator::extract_boundary_mesh() now copies the
  manifold ids of edges of the volume mesh to the manifold ids of the edges
  of the extracted surface mesh.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::create_triangulation() now accepts subcell-data
  objects that may include information about interior edges and faces, to
  facilitate setting manifold indicators on interior edges and faces.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/25)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::extract_boundary_mesh() in 3d could generate
  surface cells that did not uniformly had a right- or left-handed coordinate
  system associated with them when viewed from one side of the surface. This
  has been fixed: they now all have a right-handed coordinate system when seen
  from one side of the surface, and a left-handed one when viewed from the
  other side.
  <br>
  (Daniel Weygand, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/11/22)
  </li>

  <li> New: Extra parameters to GD and Lanczos SLEPc solvers. Also added unit tests.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: FETools::project_dg was adding the vector projection to
  the output vector. Now is the output vector initialized to zero.
  <br>
  (Adam Kosik, 2015/11/09)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: A compilation issue with DEAL_II_INCLUDE_DIRS not used for
  compiling bundled boost.
  <br>
  (Lukas Korous, 2015/11/01)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: PolynomialsBDM::degree() now returns the correct value.
  <br>
  (Alistair Bentley, 2015/10/24)
  </li>

  <li> New: Triangulation::set_all_manifold_ids_on_boundary(boundary_id, manifold_id)
  which sets the manifold_id for all parts of the boundary with a given boundary_id.
  <br>
  (Alberto Sartori, 2015/10/22)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The range vectors in the construction of an
  inverse_operator() is now reinitialised before solve calls. This ensures
  a consistent starting point for the solver.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/10/19)
  </li>

  <li> New: Ghost cells for the multigrid levels in
  parallel::distributed::Triangulation are now correctly created also for
  periodic boundary conditions.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/10/18)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: GridGenerator::subdivided_parallelepiped() produced
  invalid, unconnected meshes and wrong boundary indicators.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/10/13)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: DoFTools::compute_intergrid_transfer_representation
  can now be used with a fine grid given by a parallel::Triangulation.
  <br>
  (Alexander Grayver, 2015/10/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: GridIn::read_unv() can now read more element codes that
  are used in typical meshes.
  <br>
  (Aslan Kosakian, 2015/10/06)
  </li>

  <li> New: DoFTools::locally_relevant_dofs_per_subdomain() can be used
  to extract an IndexSet of locally relevant DoFs for a Triangulation
  partitioned using METIS or with a parallel::shared::Triangulation .
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, 2015/09/24)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: hp::SolutionTransfer could get confused when dealing with
  FE_Nothing elements. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Claire Bruna-Rosso, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/23)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The construction of the non-local graph for quick data
  exchange of TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix became very slow for a few
  thousand processors. This has been fixed.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Initializing a TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix from a
  DynamicSparsityPattern included some O(global_size) operations. These have
  been replaced by operations only on the local range.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/09/22)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: All doxygen-generated pages now contain a link to the
  tutorial in their top-level menus.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/13)
  </li>

  <li>Cleanup: Constructors of AdditionalData in various linear solvers are now marked
  explicit. This avoid bugs with implicit conversions like the one fixed in step-40.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, Lei Qiao, 2015/09/09)
  </li>

  <li>New: Introduced third-order derivatives of the shape functions, which
  can now be accessed through FEValues and FEValuesViews using similar interfaces
  as shape_values, shape_derivatives and shape_hessians.
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>Cleanup: TableIndices<N> can now be used (constructed and accessed)
  with N > 7.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: std::begin and std::end are now available within the std_cxx11
  namespace through <base/std_cxx11/iterator.h>
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: MappingQ1Eulerian was not instantiated for the various
  Trilinos vector types. It is now instantiated for the same
  vector types as MappingQEulerian is.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: Introduced Hessian-related functions to the Function class.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/08)
  </li>

  <li>New: Memory consumption during compilation has been reduced by splitting
  instantiation files. For this make_instantiations now supports additional
  logic to split the the instantiations in .inst files into groups. This is
  used in fe_values.cc, error_estimator.cc, and others.
  <br>
  (Timo Heister, 2015/09/05)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function SparsityPattern::print_svg() which prints the sparsity of the matrix
  in a .svg file which can be opened in a web browser.
  <br>
  (Conrad Clevenger, 2015/09/03)
  </li>

  <li> Openmp SIMD support is now enabled for Clang version 3.6, or newer
  (or the equivalent XCode version). Further, openmp support is not any
  more falsely activated for very old clang versions.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/09/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: DoFTools::make_hanging_node_constraints() now supports
  hp-refinement cases when neither_element_dominates. To that end we look for
  a least face dominating FE inside FECollection.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: FEValues::transform() has been deprecated. The functionality
  of this function is a (small) subset of what the Mapping classes
  already provide.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/09/02)
  </li>

  <li> New: introduced hp::FECollection::find_least_face_dominating_fe(const std::set<unsigned int> &fes)
  which aims to find the least dominating finite element w.r.t. those provided
  as fe_indices in @p fes.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: step-6 now has an additional subsection in the
  "Possibilities for extensions" section that discusses how
  to create a better mesh.
  <br>
  (Konstantin Ladutenko, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: Introduce an option for FE_Nothing to dominate any other FE.
  Therefore at interfaces where, for example, a Q1 meets an FE_Nothing,
  we will force the traces of the two functions to be the same. Because the
  FE_Nothing encodes a space that is zero everywhere, this means that the Q1
  field will be forced to become zero at this interface.
  <br>
  (Denis Davydov, 2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: Jacobian second and third derivatives are now computed by the mapping classes and can be
  accessed through FEValues in much the same way as the Jacobian and Jacobian gradient.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/28-2015/08/31)
  </li>

  <li> New: There are now a collection of functions named GridTools::compute_active_cell_halo_layer()
  that determine which cells form a layer around a specified subdomain. There is also a function
  GridTools::compute_ghost_cell_halo_layer() that returns the smallest layer of ghost cells around
  all locally relevant cells.
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, Denis Davydov, Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/21)
  </li>

  <li> Documentation: How to set up a testsuite in a user project is now
  properly documented.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/01 - 2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: The computation of gradients in FE_PolyTensor and its derived classes (in particular in
  FE_RaviartThomas and FE_Nedelec) forgot to account for terms that appear on non-affine
  cells. Consequently, the computed gradients did not match the actual derivatives of the values
  these elements report. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/18-2015/08/20)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Generalized conversion between Tensor<order+1,dim> and
  DerivativeForm<order,dim,dim> to general order using converting constructor
  and assignment operator.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/01-2015/08/09)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The function Vector::ratio() and the corresponding
  functions in other vector classes have been deprecated.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Bruno Turcksin, 2015/08/13)
  </li>

  <li> New: Direct support for Abaqus mesh files has been added to the GridIn
  class through the function GridIn::read_abaqus().
  <br>
  (Jean-Paul Pelteret, Timo Heister,  Krzysztof Bzowski, 2015/08/12)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: Finite elements now compute hessians analytically rather than
  by finite differencing.
  <br>
  (Maien Hamed, 2015/08/01-2015/08/09)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function Mapping::project_real_point_to_unit_point_on_face()
  that calls Mapping::transform_real_to_unit_cell() and then projects the
  result to a provided face.
  <br>
  (Jason Sheldon, 2015/08/11)
  </li>

  <li> New: FEFaceValues and FESubfaceValues can now also compute
  gradients of the Jacobian of the transformation from unit to real cell,
  controlled by update_jacobian_grads.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/08/08)
  </li>

  <li> New: There is now a function MemoryConsumption::memory_consumption()
  for std_cxx11::unique_ptr arguments.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/08/07)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: CMake configuration: The DEAL_II_ADD_TEST now also
  supports unit tests writing to stdout and stderr. Further, a second test
  type consisting of an internal executable target, a configuration and a
  comparison file is now supported.
  <br>
  (Matthias Maier, 2015/08/03)
  </li>

  <li> New: VtkFlags now stores a parameter describing the compression level
  zlib uses when writing compressed output. For small problems, the flag
  ZlibCompressionLevel::best_speed can make the call to write_vtu many times
  faster.
  <br>
  (David Wells, 2015/08/03)
  </li>

  <li> Improved: The conversion Epetra_Map -> IndexSet is now an O(1)
  operation for contiguous index ranges, improving over the old O(N) behavior.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, 2015/07/30)
  </li>

  <li> Changed: The initialization methods of TrilinosWrappers::SparseMatrix,
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparseMatrix, TrilinosWrappers::SparsityPattern, and
  TrilinosWrappers::BlockSparsityPattern with Epetra_Map arguments have been
  marked as deprecated. Use the functions with IndexSet argument instead.
  <br>
  (Martin Kronbichler, Luca Heltai, 2015/07/30)
  </li>

  <li> New: FESystem now does some work in parallel if your system
  has multiple processors.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/19)
  </li>

  <li> Fixed: When using FESystem with base elements that require
  information other than the determinant of the Jacobian (e.g.,
  elements that require the Jacobian itself), then this information
  was not passed down to FiniteElement::fill_fe_values of the
  base element. This is now fixed.
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, Zhen Tao, 2015/07/17)
  </li>

  <li> New: The parallel::distributed::Triangulation can now be told to
  partition the cells so that the sum of certain weights associated with each
  cell, rather than the number of cells, is roughly constant between processors.
  This is done by passing a vector of weights to the function that repartitions
  the triangulation, parallel::distributed::Triangulation::repartition().
  <br>
  (Wolfgang Bangerth, 2015/07/14)
  </li>

  <li> New: DataOutBase::TecplotFlags now takes a third argument for solution
  time which is useful to visualize transient data. If a user sets a non-negative
  time, it will be saved into the tecplot file.
  <br>
  (Praveen Chandrashekar, 2015/08/30)
  </li>
